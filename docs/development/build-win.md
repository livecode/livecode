## Dependencies

The Windows build scripts currently don't have any ability to auto-discover tools, so you need to **install all of the build dependencies to their default locations**.

### git

You will need to install [git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) in order to obtain the LiveCode source code from GitHub.

### Microsoft Visual Studio

You need a set of Visual Studio build tools and SDKS.  You can use either:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools),
  which contains _only_ the compilers and libraries, without any user
  interface; select everything in the installer


- An appropriate edition of the
  [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudio.com/downloads/) IDE

In addition, you should install
[Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=10121)
in order to allow you to compile the `revspeech` external.

Note : If Using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, you will need to add C++ support and 
support for the Windows 8.1 SDK to your Visual Studio installation as these features are currently
not installed by default with Visual Studio 2017 and are necessary for building LiveCode.

### Cygwin

The build currently requires the use of some tools from the Cygwin distribution of GNU and other open source tools.

You need to [install Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html), along with the following additional packages:

* make
* bash
* bison
* flex
* curl
* zip
* unzip

### Other tools

The build process also requires:

* [ActiveState Perl](https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads) Community Edition
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) (Python 3 isn't supported)

## Configuring LiveCode

Once you have checked out the source code from git, you can run:

````
cmd /C configure.bat
````

(Or just run `configure.bat` by double-clicking on it from Windows Explorer)

This will generate a set of Visual Studio project files in the `build-win-x86/livecode` directory.

## Compiling LiveCode

If you installed the Visual Studio IDE, you can open the
`build-win-x86/livecode/livecode.sln` solution file in Visual Studio,
and build LiveCode from there.

If you installed the Visual Studio build tools, you can run:

````
cd build-win-x86
set BUILD_PLATFORM=win-x86
cmd /C ..\make.cmd
````
