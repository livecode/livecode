Parameters:

An expression that evaluates to a number.

chunk:
A chunk expression specifying a portion of the container.

Description:
Use the <add> <command> to add a number to a <container> or a portion of
a <container>, or to add two <array|arrays> containing numbers.

The contents of the <container> (or the <chunk> of the <container>) must
be a number or an <expression> that <evaluate|evaluates> to a number.

If a <number> is added to an <arrayContainer>, the <number> is added to
each <element(glossary)>. If an <array> is added to an <arrayContainer>,
both <array|arrays> must have the same number of
<element(glossary)|elements> and the same dimension, and each
<element(glossary)> in the <array> is added to the corresponding
<element(glossary)> of the <arrayContainer>.

If the <container> or an <element(glossary)> of the <arrayContainer> is
empty, the <add> <command> treats its contents as zero.
If <container> is a <field> or <button>, the <format> of the sum is
determined by the <numberFormat> <property>.
