startingColor:
A <color reference> in one of the following forms:

-  a standard color name
-  three comma-separated integers between zero and 255, specifying the
   level of each of red, green, and blue
-  an HTML-style color consisting of a hash mark (#) followed by three
   hexadecimal numbers, one for each of red, green, and blue.


It:
The color the user chooses is placed in the <it> <variable>.

The result:
If the user cancels the <dialog box|dialog>, the <it> <variable> is set
to empty, and the <result> <function> <return|returns> "Cancel".

Description:
Use the <answer color> <command> to select a custom color.

The <answer color> <command> displays a <dialog box> where the user can
select a color. (This dialog box is displayed by the operating system,
not by LiveCode.)

If you specify a <startingColor>, the dialog box displays that color by
default. 

The color is returned in the form of three comma-separated integers
between zero and 255, specifying the level of each of red, green, and
blue. This format can be used directly to set any color property.

Changes:
The option to specify a startingColor was introduced in version 1.1.1.
In previous versions, the dialog box displayed white by default.
