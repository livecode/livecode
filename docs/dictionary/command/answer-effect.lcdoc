It:
An encoded description of the visual effect the user chooses is placed
in the it <variable>. You can either use the encoded description
immediately, or store it (for example, in a <variable> or in a <custom
property>) for later use. To display the effect, use the encoded
description with the <visual effect> <command>, with the <unlock screen>
<command>, or with the hide with visual effect or show with visual
effect form of the <hide> or <show> <command>. If the user cancels the
dialog, the it <variable> is set to empty, and the <result> <function>
<return|returns> "Cancel".

The result:
If the user cancels the dialog, the it <variable> is set to empty, and
the <result> <function> <return|returns> "Cancel".

Description:
Use the <answer effect> <command> to choose a visual effect, or to set
up an effect with complex options for later use.

The <answer effect> <command> displays a <dialog box> where the user can
select a visual effect and (for some effects) set parameters such as
speed and direction. (This <dialog box> is displayed by <QuickTime>, not
by LiveCode.)

Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
