Synonyms: answer directory

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop,web

Security: disk

Example:
answer folder "Please choose a folder:"

Example:
if it is empty then answer folder chooseMsg as sheet

Example:
answer folder "Where is the data?" with "../data_stacks/recent"

Parameters:
prompt (string): If you specify empty, no prompt appears.
defaultPath: The name and location of the folder whose contents are listed when the dialog box appears. If no defaultPath is specified, the dialog box lists the contents of the last folder you used with a file dialog box.

The result: If the user cancels the <dialog box|dialog>, the <it> <variable> is set to empty, and the <result> function <return|returns> "cancel".

It: The absolute file path of the folder the user selects is placed in the it <variable>.

Description:
Use the <answer folder> <command> when you want the user to choose a <folder> --for example, as a destination for <export|exported> <files>.

If the as sheet form is used, the dialog box appears as a sheet on OS X systems. On other systems, the as sheet form has no effect and the dialog box appears normally. Attempting to open a sheet from within another sheet displays the second stack as a <modal dialog box> instead.  To give a dialog box a prompt when using the as sheet form a non-empty title must be provided.  This will cause the prompt to appear in the same place it would if as sheet was not being used.

If the systemFileSelector <property> is set to false, LiveCode's built-in <dialog box> is used instead of the operating system's <file dialog box|standard file dialog>.

Changes:
The answer folder...as sheet form was introduced in version 2.0.
