If the <systemPrintSelector property> is false or the system does not support native print dialogs a stack named "Printer Dialog" will be used. If the <systemPrintSelector property> is true then a dialog will be displayed by the operating system, in this case the exact options are determined by the printer driver and the operating system.

If the user does not cancel the dialog, upon return the printer setting properties will be updated to reflect their choices.
