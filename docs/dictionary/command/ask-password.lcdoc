Name: ask password

Type: command

Syntax: ask password [clear] <question> [with <defaultResponse>] [titled <windowTitle>] [as sheet]

Summary: Displays a <dialog box> like the <ask> <command>, but with the characters the user types displayed as asterisks (*) for privacy.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,web,mobile

Example:
ask password "Please enter password"
get mcEncrypt(it)

Example:
ask password "Please log in." titled "Millenium Group Intranet"

Example:
ask password empty with savedPassword as sheet

Example:
ask password "Please log in:" with "PASSWORD" titled "Password Test"

Parameters:
question (string): The string to display as a prompt above the password entry box. 
windowTitle: If specified, appears in the title bar of the dialog box. If no windowTitle is given, the title bar is blank.
defaultResponse: Placed in the text box when the dialog box appears. If no defaultResponse is specified, the text box is empty when the dialog box appears.

The result: If the user cancels the <dialog box|dialog>, the <it> <variable> is set to empty, and the <result> <function> <return|returns> "cancel".

It: The text contents of the text box is placed in the it <variable>. If the ask password clear form is used, the text box is not encrypted, and the it <variable> contains whatever the user entered (this is the default behavior).

Description:
Use the <ask password> <command> to provide privacy for the information the user types. For example, if the user is in a public place, the information might be seen by someone looking over his or her shoulder. This command does not <encrypt> the text the user types, but you can use <ask password> to implement a secret <password with the syntax shown in the example section.>.

If the ask password...as sheet form is used, the dialog box appears as a sheet on OS X systems. On other systems, the as sheet form has no effect and the dialog box appears normally. Attempting to open a sheet from within another sheet displays the second stack as a <modal dialog box> instead.

>*Note:* Android and iOS do not support 'as sheet'.

Changes:
'ask password clear' set to the default behavior at version 6.0.0 to provide compatibility across all platforms.

The 'ask password...as sheet' form was introduced in version 2.0.
