Description:
Use the <choose> <command> to <select> <object|objects>, create
<object|objects>, or paint under scripted <control>.

The tool you choose is effective for all editable windows, until you
choose another tool. (The Browse tool is always in effect for stacks
whose cantModify <property> is true, and for <stacks> being displayed as
a <palette>, <modeless dialog box|modeless dialog>, or <modal dialog
box|modal dialog>.)

All types of graphics are drawn with the single Graphic tool. To draw a
specific shape, first draw with the Graphic tool, then set the style
<property> of the new <graphic> to the shape you want. (You can also set
the <style> of the <templateGraphic> to the shape you want, then draw
the <graphic> with the Graphic <tool(function)>. The <graphic> icons on
the Tools <palette> work this way: each one sets the <style> of the
<templateGraphic>, then chooses the Graphic tool.)

Similarly, all types of buttons, fields, and scrollbars can be drawn
with the single tool for that object type. You specify a particular kind
of button, field, or scrollbar by setting its style <property>.

>*Note:* You must choose <tool(glossary)|tools> by name. The <HyperCard>
> method of choosing <tool(glossary)|tools> by number is not supported
> in LiveCode.
