Description:
Use the <click> <command> to simulate the action of a click, instead of
sending a <mouseDown> or <mouseUp> message--for example, to create a
<graphic> or <image> with a <handler>.

The <click> <command> sends a <mouseDown> and <mouseUp> <message> to the
<object(glossary)> at the clicked location. If two <object|objects> both
occupy the clicked location--one overlapping the other--the
<message|messages> are sent to the <object(glossary)> on top.

If the object under the <point> is a <button> whose <autoHilite> is
true, the <click> <command> causes the <button> to <highlight> and
unhighlight, just as though the user had clicked.

If the <point> is not within one of the <application|application's>
windows, the <click> <command> has no effect. This means that you cannot
use the <click> <command> to switch to another application.
