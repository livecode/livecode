Description:
Use the <clone> <command> to create a copy of an existing
<object(glossary)>. 

If the <object(glossary)> is a <control>, its copy is placed on the 
<current card>, 32 <pixels> below and to the right of the original 
<object(glossary)>. The copy's <name> and other <properties> are the
same as those of the original. If the <object(glossary)> is a <grouped
control>, the clone is also <owner|owned> by the <group>.

>*Note:*  If invisible is specified the new object will have its
> visible 
>property set to false.

If the <object(glossary)> is a <card>, the copy becomes the <current
card>. 

If the <object(glossary)> is a <stack>, the newly created <stack> is
opened. It is named "Copy of" and the stack's name.

The <clone> <command> does not affect the contents of the <clipboard>.

If the 'as' variant is used, the newly created object is given the 
specified name.
