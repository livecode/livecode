Name: close process

Type: command

Syntax: close process <processName> 

Summary: Closes a <process> that was started with the <open process> <command>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Security: process

Example:
close process "/bin/sh"

Example:
close process tOpenProgram

Parameters:
processName: The file path to the process you opened with the open process command.

Description:
Use the <close process> <command> to tell a <process> to <exit> after you've finished using it.

On Unix and Windows systems, <close process> closes the <process|process's> <standard input>. The <process> then finishes processing whatever data remains, and exits when done. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, the <close process> <command> has no effect; you can use the <kill> <command> instead to quit an application that LiveCode launched.

The process takes a short time to exit after you issue the <close process> <command>. Since two <process|processes> cannot have the same name, you need to wait for a <process> to exit before opening a new <process> with the same name. To reopen the same <process> after closing it, use the <wait> <command> to delay until the <process> has finished exiting:

  close process myProcess
  wait until myProcess is not among the lines of the openProcesses
  open process myProcess

If a process was opened with the access mode neither, it exits automatically when it finishes running, and does not need to be closed.
