Description:
When you cut or delete a card, some free space is left within the stack. This empty space is reclaimed when you choose File menu. Use the <compact> <command> to reclaim this empty space without having to save the <stack>.

This command is especially useful when a handler performs multiple rearrangements of cards without saving the stack.

The "Save" menu item in the File menu automatically compacts the stack. However, the save <command> does not do so.
