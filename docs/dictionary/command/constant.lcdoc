Name: constant

Type: command

Syntax: constant <constantsList> 

Summary: Declares one or more labels to assign to <constant> <value|values>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
constant defaultName="Jones"

Example:
constant entryA="EF9993333WX786",entryB="GJ773281YX342"

Parameters:
constantsList (enum): The constantsList consists of one or more name=value pairs, separated by commas:
-  The name is any string.
-  The value is any literal string.

Description:
Use the <constant> <command> to assign an unchanging value to a <keyword>.

Constants can be numbers, characters, logical values, or strings.

A constant cannot be defined as an array, only as a single value.

>*Note:*  Choose easy-to-understand names for <constant(glossary)|constants> to improve the readability of your code. Use <constant(glossary)|constants> as substitutes for long or convoluted <string|strings>.

If you place the <constant> <statement> in a <handler>, you can use the <constant(command)> anywhere in the <handler>. If you place the <constant> <statement> in a <script> outside any <handler>, you can use the <constant(command)> anywhere in the <handler|handlers> of that <script>.

Once you have defined a constant, you cannot redefine it in the same handler; doing so causes an execution error.

You can use the <constant> <command> to redefine <LiveCode|LiveCode's> built-in <constant(glossary)|constants> within a <script> or <handler>, but doing so makes your code harder to read and maintain. To find out whether a word is already defined as a built-in <constant(command)>, use the <constantNames> <function>.

>*Tip:*  To see a list of built-in constants, open the Documentation window, click LiveCode Dictionary, and choose "Constants" from the menu at the top of the window.
