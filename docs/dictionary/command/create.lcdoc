Parameters:
objectType (enum): 
- "field"

objectName: The name to call the newly created object. If you don't 
specify a name, the object is created with a default name.
group: A reference or and expression that evaluates to a reference to a 
group on the current card. If you specify a group, the new object is a 
member of the group, and exists on each card that has the group. If you 
don't specify a group, the object is created on the current card and 
appears only on that card.

It: The <create> command places the ID property of the newly created 
object in the it variable.

Description:
Use the create command to make a new control or grouped control.

The new object takes its properties from the corresponding template; for 
example, newly created buttons match the properties of the 
<templateButton>.

If you use the invisible form, the object is created with its visible 
property set to false, so it cannot be seen. Use this form to create a 
hidden object, change its appearance or position, then make it visible.

When the new control is created, the Pointer tool is automatically 
chosen. If you use the create command in a handler, you can use the 
following statement after the create command to resume using the Browse 
tool:

	send "choose browse tool" to me in 1 tick

>*Note:*  In the development environment, after an object is created, 
LiveCode automatically resets the corresponding template to its default 
values. This means that if you change an object template and then create 
several objects of that type, only the first object will reflect your 
settings. To prevent LiveCode from automatically setting the template 
back to its defaults, set the <lockMessages> property to true before 
creating the objects:

	set the borderWidth of the templateButton to 8
	lock messages
	repeat for 5 times
	create button
	end repeat
	unlock messages

LiveCode resets the template only when in the development environment, 
not in standalone applications.

>*Tip:*  To create a control in a specific stack, first set the 
<defaultStack> to the stack where you want to create the new control:

	set the defaultStack to "My Stack"
	create button "My Button"
