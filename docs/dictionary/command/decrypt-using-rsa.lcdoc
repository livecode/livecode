Name: decrypt using rsa

Type: command

Syntax: decrypt <message> using rsa with {public | private} key <key> [and passphrase <passphrase>]

Summary:
Used to decrypt a file or string with RSA public or private keys 
and an optional passphrase.

Introduced: 4.6

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Security: network

Example:
decrypt tMessage using rsa with public key tPublicKey

Example:
decrypt field 1 using rsa with private key tPrivateKey

Parameters:
key:
The key to be used for the decryption, in PEM format

passphrase:
An optional passphrase

message:
The message to be decrypted

Description:
Use the <decrypt using rsa> command to decrypt a message using RSA
public key encryption.

To decode a message that a sender has encrypted with its corresponding
public key, use the form:

    decrypt tMessage with private key tPrivateKey

As a verify operation to ensure that a message has been encoded with the 
corresponding private key and it has come from one of its holders, 
use the form:

    decrypt tMessage with public key tPublicKey

> **Generating key pairs - **
> Public-private key pairs can be generated using the OpenSSL suite of
> command-line tools. For example: openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 512
> openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
> Will generate a key pair of size 512-bits, placing the private key in
> private_key.pem and the public key in public_key.pem.
