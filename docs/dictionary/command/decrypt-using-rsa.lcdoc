Name: decrypt using rsa

Type: command

Syntax: decrypt <source> using rsa with {public | private} key <key> [and passphrase <passphrase>]

Introduced: 4.6

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Security: network

Example:
decrypt tMessage using rsa with public key tPublicKey

Example:
decrypt field 1 using rsa with private key tPrivateKey

Parameters:
source:


key:
The key to be used for the decryption, in PEM format

passphrase:
An optional passphrase

message:
The message to be decrypted

Description:
Use the <decrypt using rsa> command to decrypt a message using RSA
public key encryption.

Use the form
decrypt <message> with private key <key> 
to decode a message that a sender has encrypted with its corresponding
public key.

Use the form
decrypt <message> with public key <key> 
to verify that a message has been encoded with the corresponding private
key, and there has come from one of its holders (this is a verify
operation). 

Generating key pairs
Public-private key pairs can be generated using the OpenSSL suite of
command-line tools. For example: openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 512
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
Will generate a key pair of size 512-bits, placing the private key in
private_key.pem and the public key in public_key.pem.

For more information on these utilities see
