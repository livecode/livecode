Description:
Use the <delete stack> <command> to delete a <substack>, or to purge a <main stack> from memory.

The <delete stack> <command> has different effects, depending on whether the <stack> is a <main stack> or a <substack>.

If the <stack> is a <main stack>, the <delete stack> <command> removes the <stack> from memory. (Any unsaved changes are lost.) However, it does not remove it from the user's system. To delete a <main stack>, use the <delete file> <command> instead.

>*Warning:*  If the <stack> is a <substack>, the <delete stack> <command> deletes the <stack> from memory, which causes it to be deleted permanently the next time its <stack file> is saved.
