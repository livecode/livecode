Description:
Use the <dispatch> command to send a message to an object, via the
message path and find out whether it was handled or not.

The <dispatch> command is most useful when using <behavior|behaviors>,

objects and then perform an action depending on the outcome.

Executing a <dispatch> command causes the <message> to be sent to the

If no <target> is specified, the <message> is sent to ' <me> '. In the
context of a <behavior>, this is typically the child that is executing
rather than the <behavior> object itself.
