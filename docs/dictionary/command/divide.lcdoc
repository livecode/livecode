number: Any expression that evaluates to a number.
arrayContainer (array): 
array (array): 

The result: If <container> is a <field> or <button>, the <format> of the result is determined by the <numberFormat> <property>.

Description:
Use the <divide> <command> to divide a <container> or a portion of a <container> by a number, or to divide two <array|arrays> containing numbers.

The contents of the <container> (or the <chunk> of the <container>) must be a number or an <expression> that <evaluate|evaluates> to a number.

If an <arrayContainer> is divided by a <number>, each element is divided by the <number>. If an <arrayContainer> is divided by an <array>, both <array|arrays> must have the same number of <element(glossary)|elements> and the same dimension, and each <element(keyword)> in the <arrayContainer> is divided by the corresponding <element(keyword)> of the <array>.

If the <container> or an <element(keyword)> of the <arrayContainer> is empty, the <divide> <command> treats its contents as zero.

Attempting to divide by zero causes an execution error.
