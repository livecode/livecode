maskFile: The maskFile specifies the name and location of a file to export as an image mask. You can use a maskFile only when exporting in PBM format (paint).
image: A reference to an image. The metadata is an array of metadata. Currently the only key supported is "density" with a value in pixels per inch (ppi).

Description:
Use the <export> <command> to <export> an <image> to a <file> or <container>.

If you use the form export <format> to..., the selected <image> is exported.

The export paint form exports the image as a PBM, PGM, or PPM file, depending on the image's colors. (Optionally, you can specify a location for the mask file.) The export JPEG form exports as a JPEG file, the export PNG form exports as a PNG file and the export BMP form exports as a BMP. If you don't specify a <format>, the file is exported as <PBM>, PGM, or <PPM>.
