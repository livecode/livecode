Description:
Use the <hide groups> <command> to remove the underline from grouped text.

Text with its textStyle set to "link" is treated specially by the <clickText>, <clickChunk>, <mouseText>, and <mouseChunk> <function|functions>: a style run of <grouped text> is treated as a single <word>. This makes <grouped text> handy to use for <hypertext> or "clickable text" features.

The <hide groups> <command> sets the <global> <underlineLinks> <property> to false. It does not affect the <stack> <underlineLinks> <property>, so if a <stack|stack's> <underlineLinks> is true, <hide groups> does not remove the underlining in that <stack>.
