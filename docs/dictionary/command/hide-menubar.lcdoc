Use the <hide menubar> <command> to use the full screen. For example, in a kiosk or multimedia application, the <menu bar> is a distraction for users and in this case you may prefer to hide it.

The menu bar can be hidden only on Mac OS and OS X systems. On OS X systems, the <hide menubar> <command> also hides the Dock. This <command> has no effect on <Windows> or <Unix|Unix systems>.

Hiding the menu bar in LiveCode does not affect its appearance in other applications; if the user switches to another application, the menu bar becomes visible. If the user switches back to LiveCode, the menu bar is hidden again.
