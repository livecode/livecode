Description:
Use the <hide> <command> to hide <object|objects> temporarily or
permanently. 

Hiding an object sets its visible <property> to false. The
<object(glossary)> itself is still in the <stack> and can be restored
with the <show> <command>. You can also set the <showInvisibles>
<property> to true to override the <visible> <property> and show all
<object|objects>. 

Hiding a stack hides its window, but does not close the stack. If the
stack is being displayed as a drawer, hiding it slides it back into its
parent stack.

You can hide a card without causing a script error, but doing so has no
effect. 

Hiding a group hides all the controls in the group.

Changes:
The ability to use QuickTime special effects was introduced in version
1.1. In previous versions, only the built-in visual effects listed under
the visual effect command were available.

The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
