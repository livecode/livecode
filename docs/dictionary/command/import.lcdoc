Name: import

Type: command

Syntax: import <type> from file <filePath> [with mask <maskFilePath>]

Summary:
Creates an <image>, <EPS>, <audio clip>, or <video clip> and copies the
contents of a <file> into the <object(glossary)>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, mobile

Security: disk

Example:
import paint from file "flowers.jpeg"

Example:
import audioClip from file "/sounds/temp/bugsounds.wav"

Example:
import paint from file it with mask "/etc/res/oval.pbm"

Parameters:
type:
One of paint, EPS, audioClip, or videoClip.

filePath:
The filePath specifies the name and location of the file you want to
import from. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes
the file is in the defaultFolder.

maskFilePath:
The maskFilePath specifies the name and location of a one-bit mask file
for an image. You can use a mask file only if the file being imported is
in the PBM format.

Description:
Use the <import> <command> to place a sound, movie, or <image> in a
<stack>, instead of creating a <referenced control> that uses an
external file.

The imported object is placed in the current stack. To change the
current stack before importing, set the <defaultStack> <property> to the
stack you want to import into, then import the <file>. Importing a paint
file creates an image object on the current card. The <import> command
can import <GIF>, <JPEG>, <PNG>, <BMP>, <XWD>, <XBM>, <XPM>, or <PBM>,
<PGM>, or <PPM> <files>. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, <PICT> <files> can
also be <import|imported> (but they cannot be displayed on <Unix> or
<Windows|Windows systems>). Importing an EPS file creates an EPS object
on the current card. Importing an audioClip or videoClip file creates an
audio clip or video clip in the current stack. Audio files can be in
WAV, AIFF, or AU format. Video files can be in <QuickTime>, <AVI>, or
<MPEG> <format>.

>*Note:* The <import> <command> places the data in the <stack file>
> itself. This assures that the information stays with the <stack> if
> it's moved, but it also increases the <stack|stack's> size and the
> amount of memory used by the <stack>. If you prefer to keep the data
> outside the <stack file>, you can display a picture file without
> importing it by creating an <image> and setting its
> <filename> <property>, or by choosing File → New Referenced Control →
> Image File… from the menubar. To allow playing a sound or movie
> without importing it, create a player and set its filename prop, or
> choose File → New Referenced Control → Video File… .

Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
