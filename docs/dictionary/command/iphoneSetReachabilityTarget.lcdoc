Description:
Use the iphoneSetReachabilityTarget command to start monitoring a specific server for reachability via the network.

The network connection on iOS devices is generally more transient than normal network connections and can change between wireless and wide-area wireless (GPRS, 3G, EDGE etc.) transport as it moves, and indeed be lost entirely.

As the behavior of an application may vary depending on what kind of network connection is present it is useful to be able to monitor a given server for the type of connection the device currently has to it.

To start monitoring a specific server for reachability via the network use the <iphoneSetReachabilityTarget> command.
