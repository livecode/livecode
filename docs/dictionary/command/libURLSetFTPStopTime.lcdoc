Description:
Use the <libURLSetFTPStopTime> <command> to increase the efficiency of multiple FTP transfers.

When LiveCode opens a socket to a host in order to upload or download a file via <ftp>, or to delete a file, it leaves the connection open for a time after the transaction completes. If another <file> is requested from the same FTP <server> during that time, LiveCode uses the same <socket> instead of opening another one. This saves time if you are transferring multiple files with the same <server>, since the <socket> does not need to be set up again for each file.

By default, the timeout value is 15 seconds.

>*Note:* If the <server> closes the connection, LiveCode does not attempt to keep it open. The <timeout> set by <libURLSetFTPStopTime> controls when LiveCode closes the connection from its end, but if the <server> closes the connection, a longer <timeout> has no effect.

>*Important:*  The <libURLSetFTPStopTime> <command> is part of the <Internet library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "Internet Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.

>*Note:* When included in a <standalone application>, the <Internet library> is implemented as a hidden <group> and made available when the <group> receives its first <openBackground> message. During the first part of the <application|application's> startup process, before this <message> is sent, the <libURLSetFTPStopTime> <command> is not yet available. This may affect attempts to use this <command> in <startup>, <preOpenStack>, <openStack>, or <preOpenCard> <handler|handlers> in the <main stack>. Once the <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is available and the <libURLSetFTPStopTime> <command> can be used in any <handler>.
