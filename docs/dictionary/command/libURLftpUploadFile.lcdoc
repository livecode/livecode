Example:

Parameters:
filePath: The filePath specifies the name and location of the file you want to upload. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode     assumes the file is in the defaultFolder.
uploadURL: The uploadURL specifies the server and location to upload to, in the form of an FTP URL.
callbackMessage: The name of a message to send after the file is uploaded.

Description:
Use the <libURLftpUploadFile> <command> to put a <file> on a <server>.

The <libURLftpUploadFile> <command> transfers the data directly from the <file> to the <server>. Unlike <libURLftpUpload> (or the <put> <command> used with an <FTP> <URL>), the data does not all need to be in memory at once, so this <command> is a better choice for large <files>.

The <libURLftpUploadFile> <command> transfers the file in <binary> mode.

The <callbackMessage> is sent to the <object> whose <script> contains the <libURLftpUpload> <command>, after the <upload> is complete, so you can handle the <callbackMessage> to perform any tasks you want to delay until the file has been <upload|uploaded>. Two <parameter|parameters> are sent with the <message> : the <URL> and the <URLStatus> of the <file>.

>*Important:*  The <libURLftpUploadFile> <command> is part of the <Internet library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "Internet Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.

>*Note:* When included in a <standalone application>, the <Internet library> is implemented as a hidden <group> and made available when the <group> receives its first <openBackground> message. During the first part of the <application|application's> startup process, before this <message> is sent, the <libURLftpUploadFile> <command> is not yet available. This may affect attempts to use this <command> in <startup>, <preOpenStack>, <openStack>, or <preOpenCard> <handler|handlers> in the <main stack>. Once the <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is available and the <libURLftpUploadFile> <command> can be used in any <handler>.
