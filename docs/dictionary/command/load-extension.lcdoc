Name: load extension

Type: command

Syntax: load extension {from file <filePath> | from data <moduleData>} [ with resource path <resourcePath> ]

Summary:
Load a LiveCode Builder extension.

Introduced: 8.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
load extension from file "packaged_extensions/com.livecode.widget.navbar/module.lcm"
if the result is empty then
    create widget "My Navbar" as "com.livecode.widget.navbar"
end if

Example:
local tExtensionData
put url ("binfile:" \
      & tMyExtensionFolder & slash & "module.lcm" ) into tExtensionData
load extension from data tExtensionData with resource path (tMyExtensionFolder \
      & slash & "resources" )

Parameters:
filePath:
The path to a compiled <LiveCode Builder extension> file.

moduleData:
Binary data that constitutes a valid compiled 
<LiveCode Builder extension>. 

resourcePath:
The path to use for any operations in the 
<LiveCode Builder extension|extensions> 
that use resource files (eg 'image from resource file'). 

The result:
If the <load extension> <command> succeeds, the <result> is empty.
Otherwise the <result> contains an error message describing why the
extension could not be loaded.

Description:
Use the <load extension> <command> to load a 
<LiveCode Builder extension>. If the extension is a library, its 
public handlers will be added to the bottom of the message path. 
If it is a widget, it will be available as a control in the tools 
palette to drag out, or to create with the <create widget> <command>.

If the <moduleData> or the data loaded from <filePath> contains more
than one LiveCode Builder module, then the first module is treated as
the extension's main module and the remaining modules are treated as
support modules.  Support modules are only kept loaded if they are
used by the main module.  Support modules' names must begin with the
name of the main module.

Changes:
The ability to load multiple modules in a single <load extension>
command was added in LiveCode 9.0.
