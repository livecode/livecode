Type: command

Syntax: lock [the] clipboard

Summary: Locks the clipboard to prevent updates by other apps.

Introduced: 8.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
lock the clipboard

Description:
Use the <lock clipboard> <command> to ensure that other apps do not change the contents of the clipboard while you are working with it.

>*Note:* If you use the <clipboardData> or <fullClipboardData> properties, locking the clipboard is not required (it will be done automatically) but is recommended.

While the clipboard is locked, the contents of the clipboard available via the <clipboardData>, <fullClipboardData> and <rawClipboardData> properties will not change due to accesses by other apps. Similarly, changes made within LiveCode will not be visible to other apps until the clipboard is unlocked (using the <unlock clipboard> <command>).

>*Tip:* Use <lock clipboard> to ensure the clipboard does not change between accesses.
