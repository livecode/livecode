If you want to move more than one object simultaneously, first use the <lock moves> command to prevent these motions from being seen. Then issue the necessary move commands to move the objects, appending "without waiting" to each. Finally, use unlock moves to show the result of the move commands.

The <lock moves> command sets the lockMoves property to true.

When all pending handlers are finished executing, the <lockMoves> property is set back to false.
