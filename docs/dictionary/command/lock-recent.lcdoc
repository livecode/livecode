Description:
Use the <lock recent> command to move among <card(object)|cards> without disturbing the <recent cards|recent cards list>.

When either the user or a handler navigates to a card, that card is placed on the recent cards list, and the user can return to it with the go <command> or the "Go Recent" item in the View <menu>. If a <handler> visits a <card(keyword)> that is not normally seen by the user, you can use the <lock recent> <command> to prevent the user from inadvertently going to that <card(keyword)> later.

The <lock recent> <command> sets the <lockRecent> <property> to true. When all pending <handler|handlers> are finished <execute|executing>, the <lockRecent> <property> is set back to false.
