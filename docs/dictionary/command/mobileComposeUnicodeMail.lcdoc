listing the attachments to include. A single attachment array should
consist of the following keys:

- "data": The binary data to attach to the email (not needed if a file
  is present).
- "file": The filename of the file on disk to attach to the email (not
  needed if data present).


The result (enum):
Set by <mobileComposeUnicodeMail> to indicate its results.

-   sent: the email was sent successfully
-   cancel: the email was not sent, and the user elected not to save it
    for later


Description:
Use the <mobileComposeUnicodeMail> <command> to create a unicode email
message with attachments from within a <stack on iOS or Android>.

This command interfaces with the iOS and Android mail composition
interface 

If you specify a file for the attachment, the engine tries to use the
least amount of memory by asking the operating system to only load it
from disk when the file is needed. Therefore, using
<mobileComposeUnicodeMail> should be the preferred method when attaching
large amounts of data to an e-mail. For example, sending multiple
attachments may be done like this:

    put "Hello World!" into tAttachments[1]["data"]
    put "text/plain" into tAttachments[1]["type"]
    put "Greetings.txt" into tAttachments[1]["name"]
    put "Goodbye World!" into tAttachments[2]["data"]
    put "text/plain" into tAttachments[2]["type"]
    put "Farewell.txt" into tAttachments[2]["name"]
    mobileComposeUnicodeMail tSubject, tTo, tCCs, tBCCs, tBody, tAttachments

Some devices are not configured with e-mail sending capability. To
determine if the current device is, use the <mobileCanSendMail>
function. This returns true if the mail client is configured.

>*Note:* Once the <mobileComposeUnicodeMail> command is called, you have
> no more control over what the user does with the message. They are
> free to modify the message and the addresses as they see fit.
