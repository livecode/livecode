property (enum): The property to be set. Global properties (All native mobile controls) Global properties (All native iOS controls) Browser Specific Properties Scroller Specific Properties Player Specific Properties Text Input Specific Properties Multi-line Text Input Specific Properties
- "rect": the bounds of the control, relative to the top-left of the card. For example "0,0,100,100".
- "visible": set to true or false to determine whether the control should be displayed.
- "alpha": set to a property between 0 and 255 to blend the control with any controls underneath it.
- "backgroundColor": Set to either a standard color name, or a string of the form red,green,blue or red,green,blue,alpha. Where the components are integers in the range 0 to 255.
- "opaque": set to false if the control should be rendered with transparency. In particular, set this control to true if you set a backgroundColor that is not fully opaque.
- "ignoreVoiceOverSensitivity": set to true or false to determine whether the control should be accessible through Voice Over.
- "URL": the URL to be loaded into the web-view.
- "autoFit" (iOS Only): set to true or false to determine whether the page is scaled to fit the rect of the control (wraps the scalesPageToFit property of UIWebView).
- "delayRequests" (iOS Only): set to true to cause the loadRequest message to be sent. Note: In this mode, web-pages that trigger sub-document loads (such as those containing iframes) do not load correctly.
- "dataDetectorTypes" (iOS Only): Use this property to specify the types of data that should be automatically converted to clickable URLs in the web-view. This property wraps the dataDetectorTypes property of UIWebView. It is specified as a comma-delimited list of one or more of the following properties:
	- "phone number": 
	- "calendar event": iOS4.0+
	- "link": 
	- "address": iOS4.0+
- "allowsInlinePlayback" (iOS Only): set to true if the web-view should allow media files to be played 'inline' in the page (wraps the allowsInlineMediaPlayback property of the UIWebView). This property is only available on iOS4.0 and later
- "mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction" (iOS Only): set to false to allow media files to play automatically in the webview (wraps the mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction property of the UIWebView). This property is only available on iOS4.0 and later.
- "scrollingEnabled": specifies whether or not the browser can be scrolled (boolean).
- "canBounce": determines whether the scroller 'bounces' when it hits the edge of the contentRect.
- "contentRect": The rectangle over which the scroller scrolls. This is distinct from the scroller's rect. The minimum/maximum values of the scroll properties (adjusted for the size of the scroller). This is a comma-separated list of four integers, describing a rectangle. For example "0,0,100,100".
- "hScroll": The horizontal scroll offset. This is an integer value ranging between the left and right of the contentRect, adjusting appropriately for the size of the scroller (i.e. contentRect.left to contentRect.right - rect.width).

- "hIndicator": Determines whether the horizontal indicator should be displayed when scrolling (maps to the UIScrollView showsHorizontalScrollIndicator property). This is a boolean value.
- "vIndicator": Determines whether the vertical indicator should be displayed when scrolling (maps to the UIScrollView showsVerticalScrollIndicator property). This is a boolean value.

This can be either normal, fast or a real number*. Setting the real number currently has little effect above the 'fast' and 'normal' settings. While iOS accepts any real number, it translates the number to one of those two settings.
- "indicatorStyle" (iOS Only): Determines the style of indicators to display (maps to the UIScrollView indicatorStyle property).
	- "default": 
	- "white": 
	- "black": 
- "indicatorInsets" (iOS Only): Determines how far from the edge of the scroller's bounds, the indicators are inset (maps to the UIScrollView scrollIndicatorInsets property). This is a comma-separated list of four integers, describing the left, top, right and bottom inset distances. For example "0,0,100,100".

- "shouldAutoplay" (iOS Only): Determines whether the playback of network-based content begins automatically when there is enough buffered data to ensure uninterrupted playback (maps to the native shouldAutoplay property). This is a boolean value.
- "allowsAirPlay" (iOS Only): Determines whether a control should be presented to allow the user to choose AirPlay-enabled hardware for playback (maps to the native allowsAirPlay property). This is a boolean value. This property is only supported on iOS 4.3 and later.

Description:
Use the <mobileControlSet> command to set properties of a native mobile control created using <mobileControlCreate>.

When setting the "ignoreVoiceOverSensitivity" property of a native iOS control to "true", then this control can interact with Voice Over. Remember to set this property back to "false" when this control is no longer on the current view.
