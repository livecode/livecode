Description:
Use <mobileHideStatusBar> to hide the status bar on mobile devices. The status bar on most mobile devices is used to indicate core device status to the user like signal and battery charge.

<mobileHideStatusBar> does not have any effect on any Android devices with "hardware buttons" embedded in the status bar. For example: "back, home and menu". On these devices, hiding the status bar would remove the buttons and prevent the user from exiting the application.
