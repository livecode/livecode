Description:
By default, iOS and Android dim the screen and eventually lock the device after periods of no user interaction. Use the <mobileLockIdleTimer> command to prevent iOS or Android from dimming or locking the screen. To return to the default behavior use <mobileUnlockIdleTimer>.

Locking the idle timer increments an internal lock count, while unlocking the idle timer decrements the lock count. When the lock count goes from 0 to 1, the idleTimer is turned off; when the lock count goes from 1 to 0, the idleTimer is turned on.
