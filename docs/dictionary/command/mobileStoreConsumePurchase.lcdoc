The command <mobileStoreConsumePurchase> is used to consume a purchased item. This removes the item from the user's inventory.

>*Note:*  This command is only used when interacting with Google Play Store in-app purchasing API. This is due to a Google API restriction that ensures a consumable product is consumed before another instance is purchased. Consume means that the purchase is removed from the user's inventory of purchased items, allowing the user buy that product again.

>*Note:*  This command must only be called on consumable products. If you call mobileStoreConsumePurchase on a non-consumable product, then you no longer own that product.
