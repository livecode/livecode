Name: modeless

Type: command

Syntax: modeless <stack> 

Summary: Opens a <stack> in a <modeless dialog box|modeless dialog> window.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server

Example:
modeless stack "Hello World"

Example:
modeless the defaultStack

Parameters:
stack: Any stack reference.

Description:
Use the <modeless> <command> to display a <stack> as a custom <modeless dialog box>.

A modeless dialog box behaves like an ordinary window, except that it cannot be edited. Use modeless dialog boxes to ask the user for information.

To edit a modeless dialog box, use the <topLevel> <command> to display it in an <editable window>.

The <modeless> <command> closes the <stack> and reopens it as a <modeless dialog box>, so <closeStack> and <openStack>, <closeCard> and <openCard>, and (if applicable) <closeBackground> and <openBackground> <message|messages> are sent to the <current card> as a result of <execute|executing> this <command>. Use the <lock messages> <command> before <execute|executing> <modeless> if you want to prevent the close <message|messages> from being sent; the open <message|messages> are sent regardless of the setting of the <lockMessages> <property>.

If the stack is already displayed as a modeless dialog box, the <modeless> <command> does not close and reopen it.

The Browse tool is used in modeless dialog boxes, regardless of the current setting of the tool <property>.
