variable: 

    on printSomeCards
        global cardsToPrint
        open printing to pdf "test.pdf"
        repeat with x = 1 to the number of lines of cardsToPrint
           print card (line x of cardsToPrint)
        end repeat
    close printing -- send group of cards to printer

    end printSomeCards


>*Note:* It is not necessary to set the <formatForPrinting> option on
> stacks which are being printed to PDF.

The following keys are supported:
Title, Author, Subject, Keywords, Creator, Producer
Their values can be any string.

>*Important:* The implementation of pdf printing resides in a dynamic
> library called revpdfprinter. The standalone builder will
> automatically include this in the appropriate place when building
> standalones. 

Any custom code that deals with standalones which use this feature must
make sure that the revpdfprinter library resides next to the engine
executable.
