Name: palette

Type: command

Syntax: palette <stack> 

Summary: Opens a <stack> in a <palette|palette window>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
palette stack "Tools"

Example:
palette the defaultStack

Parameters:
stack: Any stack reference.

Description:
Use the <palette> <command> to display a <stack> in a <palette(glossary)|palette window>.

Use palette windows to display tools or information about main windows.

A palette window behaves like an ordinary window, except that its appearance is different, with a narrower title bar. If the raisePalettes <property> is set to true, any <palette(glossary)|palettes> float in their own <layer>, above all ordinary windows. <palette(glossary)|palettes> cannot be resized or edited.  To edit a <palette(command)>, use the <topLevel> <command> to display it in an <editable window>.

The <palette> <command> closes the <stack> and reopens it as a <palette(command)>, so <closeStack> and <openStack>, <closeCard> and <openCard>, and (if applicable) <closeBackground> and <openBackground> <message|messages> are sent to the <current card> as a result of <execute|executing> this <command>. Use the <lock messages> <command> before <execute|executing> <palette> if you want to prevent the close <message|messages> from being sent; the open <message|messages> are sent regardless of the setting of the <lockMessages> <property>.

If the stack is already displayed as a palette, the <palette> <command> does not close and reopen it.

The Browse tool is always used in palette windows, regardless of the current setting of the tool <property>.
