Description:
Use the <play video> command to play a full screen video.

The playback uses iOS's built-in video playback support (MPMoviePlayer), and as such can use any video file supported by MPMoviePlayer, including MP4s.

On iOS 3.1.3 the video always plays with landscape orientation. On iOS 3.2 and later the orientation of the video is tied to the current interface orientation.

Appearance of the controller is tied to the <showController> property of the <templatePlayer>. Changing this property to true or false will cause the controller to be shown or hidden.

When a movie is played without a controller any touch on the screen results in a <movieTouched> message being sent to the object whose script started the video. The principal purpose of this message is to allow the <play stop> command to be used.

>*Note:*  The <movieTouched> message is not sent if the video is playing with <showController> set to true.

Playing a video can be made to loop by setting the <looping> property of the <templatePlayer> to true before executing the <play video> command. Looping a video is only supported on iOS 3.2 and later.

A section of a video can be played by setting the <playSelection> property of the <templatePlayer> to true before executing the play video command. This will use the <startTime> and <endTime> properties of the <templatePlayer> to determine what section to play. The values of these properties are interpreted as the number of milliseconds from the beginning of the video.
