Parameters:

rectangle: A valid rectangle describing the link area in the pdf.

Description:
Use the print link command to define a hyperlink within a pdf printing loop.

If the url adjective is specified, then <link> is interpreted as a URL and an external URL launching link is created in the PDF document. The given rectangle jumps to that URL when it is clicked.

If the anchor adjective is specified, then <link> is interpreted as an internal anchor name, as specified by the print anchor command, and an internal anchor link is created in the PDF document. Clicking the given rectangle jumps to that anchor.

If no adjective is specified then <link> is interpreted as a URL if it begins with (ASCII) letters followed by a colon. e.g. "mailto:foobar" is interpreted as a URL, whereas "mail-to-anchor:foo" is interpreted as an anchor name.

When printing fields, any text that has its <linkText> property set together with the link <textStyle> is treated as if a print link command had been executed with the contents of the property as <link>, and the <formattedRect> of the text as <rectangle>.
