Name: push

Type: command

Syntax: push <card> 

Summary: Places a card's long <ID> in a list, from which it can be retrieved later with the <pop> <command>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
push card -- pushes current card

Example:
push card "Starting Point"

Parameters:
card: Any card reference.

Description:
Use the <push> <command> to store one or more locations for later use, or to keep a reference to the <current card> so you can return to it after temporarily visiting another <card(keyword)>.

When you push a card, its <ID> is placed at the top of the list. The next time you use the <pop> <command>, that <card(object)|card's> ID is deleted from the list, and the previously-pushed <card(keyword)> becomes the first <line> of the list. In this way, you can store multiple locations with the <push> <command>, and use the <pop> <command> to revisit them in reverse order.

The list of pushed cards is cleared when you quit the application.

The Home card (the first card of the "license.rev" stack) is always the last card on the list.
