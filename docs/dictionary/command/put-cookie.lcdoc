Description:
Use the <put cookie> command to create a cookie with the given data in 
the visiting browser for a specific URL.

If the secure form is used, the browser only sends the cookie if 
communicating over a secure connection (https).

If the httponly form is used, the cookie is only available from the 
browser when communicating with the server and hidden from client-side 
scripting (for example JavaScript).

A cookie is used by a website to store state information in the user's 
browser, which is returned to the website on subsequent visits. Cookies 
are often used to store user preferences and session data. For example, 
you may allow a user to choose a theme through which to view your 
website and store this choice in a cookie to be used on subsequent 
visits.

When setting a cookie you can specify a path. Cookies are returned to 
all URLs within the specified path. For example, a cookie set on the 
domain "www.livecode.com" with the following path:

	/products/

is available to all pages within and under 
http://www.livecode.com/products/

To make the cookie available across your entire website, set the path 
to "/".

>*Note:* Cookies must be set before any headers are sent.
