Name: quit

Type: command

Syntax: quit [<exitCode>]

Summary: Quits the <application>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
quit 1

Example:

end if

Parameters:
exitCode: The exit status to return to the operating system.  If you don't specify an exitCode, the exit status is 0.  The exitCode must be an integer greater than or equal to 0.

Description:
Use the <quit> <command> to exit LiveCode (or a <standalone application>).

Once issued, the <quit> <command> triggers a <shutdownRequest message>.  If the <shutdownRequest message> is not passed then the quit will be blocked (i.e. the program won't close).

If you want to check a condition or ask the user for confirmation before deciding whether to quit, use an <if> <control structure>:

  on getMeOuttaHere
    answer "Are you sure you want to quit?" with "No way" or "OK"
    if it is "OK" then 
      quit
    end if
  end getMeOuttaHere

To force a quit without sending a <shutdownRequest message> use: 
  lock messages 
  quit
