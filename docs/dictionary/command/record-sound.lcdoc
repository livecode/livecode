Type: command

Syntax: record sound file <filePath>

Summary:
Starts recording from the system's audio input to a <file>.

Introduced: 1.1

OS: mac

Platforms: desktop

Parameters:
filePath:
The name and location of the file that will hold the recorded sound
data. 

The result:
>*Important:*  If the <recordFormat> is set to "movie", the resulting
> <file> is in the <QuickTime> file format. <QuickTime> files cannot be
> played as <audio clip|audio clips>. To play such a sound, either
> create a <player> and set its <filename> <property> to the <file
> path|path> of the <file> you recorded, or use the play videoclip form
> of the play <command>.

Description:
Use the <record sound> <command> to record the user's speech, import
sound data from a CD into an audio file, or record music from an
external microphone.

The <record sound> <command> uses <QuickTime> to record.

While recording is going on, the recording <property> is set to true. To
stop recording, use the <stop recording> <command> or set the
<recording> to false.

The technical specifications of the recording are determined by the
settings of the <recordCompression>, <recordChannels>, <recordRate>, and
<recordSampleSize> <properties>. The file <format> is determined by the
<recordFormat> <property>.

>*Note:* If you choose to record to a file that already exists, the
> record sound command will overwrite the existing file, it will not
> append the new recording to the end.

Changes:
The syntax of the record sound command was simplified in version 2.0. In
previous versions, specification of sample rate, compression format, and
whether to display a settings dialog box was included in the syntax for
the record sound command. These capabilities are now available using the
answer record command and the recordRate and recordCompression
properties. 

The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
