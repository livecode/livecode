Use the <replace in field> <command> to replace all instances of one <string> with another <string> in (part of) a field, with the choice as to whether styling is preserved or replaced.

If the preserving form is used, then the found strings will be replaced in the target field and the replacement text will take the same style as the first character in the found string.

If the replacing form is used, then the found strings will be replaced in the target field and the replacement text will have no style.

All styling outside of the instances of the pattern which are found is unaffected.
