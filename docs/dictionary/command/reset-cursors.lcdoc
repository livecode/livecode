the new <cursor(property)> shapes.

statements: 

    delete stack "revCursors"
    reset cursors


>*Warning:*  If you use the <delete stack> command to remove the
> "revCursors" <stack>, LiveCode's <cursor(glossary)|cursors> are
> permanently deleted and you will need to <download> a new cursors
> <stack> to restore them.
