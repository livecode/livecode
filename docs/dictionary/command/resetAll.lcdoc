Description:
Use the <resetAll> <command> to troubleshoot Internet connection problems.

The <resetAll> <command> closes all open sockets, including any <socket|sockets> that have been opened by the <Internet library>; clears all <variable|variables> used by the <Internet library>; and clears all cached data.

Since the Internet library's routines for handling http and <ftp> <upload|uploads> and <download|downloads> are <socket> -based, the <resetAll> <command> resets all these operations.

>*Warning:*  The <resetAll> <command> closes all open <socket|sockets>, which includes any other <socket|sockets> opened by your application and any <socket|sockets> in use for other <upload|uploads> and <download|downloads>. Because of this, you should avoid routine use of the <resetAll> <command>. Consider using it only during development, to clear up connection problems during <debug|debugging>.

>*Important:*  The <resetAll> <command> is part of the <Internet library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "Internet Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.

>*Note:* When included in a <standalone application>, the <Internet library> is implemented as a hidden <group> and made available when the <group> receives its first <openBackground> message. During the first part of the <application|application's> startup process, before this <message> is sent, the <resetAll> <command> is not yet available. This may affect attempts to use this <command> in <startup>, <preOpenStack>, <openStack>, or <preOpenCard> <handler|handlers> in the <main stack>. Once the <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is available and the <resetAll> <command> can be used in any <handler>.
