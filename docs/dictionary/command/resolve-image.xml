  <description>
  <p>This command resolves a short id or name of an image as would be used for
  an icon and sets it to the long ID of the image according to the documented
  rules for resolving icons.</p>
  <p>it is set empty if the command fails to resolve the image which means it's
  not on any stack in memory.</p>
