Name: revCacheGeometry

Type: command

Syntax: revCacheGeometry

Summary:
Updates Geometry settings.

Associations: geometry library

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
revCacheGeometry

Example:
if the rect of me is not savedRect then revCacheGeometry

Description:
Use the <revCacheGeometry> <command> to update the Geometry pane's
internal settings, after changing the size or position of
<control(object)|controls> that you have used the Geometry pane to
specify behavior for.

The <revCacheGeometry> <command> rebuilds the Geometry <pane|pane's>
internal settings for the controls on the current card, storing the
baseline position that the automatic positioning and scaling uses as a
starting point.

The LiveCode development environment automatically executes the
<revCacheGeometry> <command> when a <resizeControl> or <moveControl>
<message> is sent. This means that when you move or resize a <control>
in the <development environment>, its stored Geometry baseline is
normally updated automatically.

Normally, you do not need to use the <revCacheGeometry> <command> at
all, since LiveCode automatically updates the geometry settings when a
<control> is moved or resized. However, if you move or resize
<control(object)|controls> manually or in a <handler>, and the
<resizeControl> or <moveControl> <message> is not sent, you may need to
use the <revCacheGeometry> <command> to update the baseline positions.

To update the settings, use the following statement in a handler or the
message box, before changing cards or resizing the window:

    revCacheGeometry


>*Important:*  The <revCacheGeometry> <command> is part of the 
> <Geometry library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure the "Geometry" 
> library checkbox is checked.
