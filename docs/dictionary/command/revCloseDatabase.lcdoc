All open databases are closed automatically when the application quits.
However, it is recommended practice to explicitly close database
connections when your stack is finished with them.

The <revCloseDatabase> <command> closes all open <record sets (database
cursors)(glossary)> opened by the <database>, as well as closing the
<database> itself.

>*Important:*  The <revCloseDatabase> <command> is part of the 
> <Database library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure both the 
> "Database" library checkbox and those of the database drivers you are 
> using are checked.
