Description:
Use the <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> to free up memory when you're
done using the <Video library>.

The Video library loads the operating system's video capture software
into memory when you use the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command>. The
<revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> unloads this software, freeing up the
memory it uses, when you're done.

If your application uses video capture, you should execute the
<revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> either when your application is
finished using <video capture>, when the <stack> that uses 
<video capture> is closed (in a <closeStack> <handler>), or when your
application quits (in a <shutdown> <handler>).

If the video grabber was already recording video to a file, the
<revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> stops the recording.

>*Important:*  The <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> is part of the 
> <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure the
> "Video Grabber" 
> library checkbox is checked.
