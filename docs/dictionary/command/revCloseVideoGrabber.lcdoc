Description:
Use the <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> to free up memory when you're done using the <Video library>.

The Video library loads the operating system's video capture software into memory when you use the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command>. The <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> unloads this software, freeing up the memory it uses, when you're done.

If your application uses video capture, you should execute the <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> either when your application is finished using <video capture>, when the <stack> that uses <video capture> is closed (in a <closeStack> <handler>), or when your application quits (in a <shutdown> <handler>).

If the video grabber was already recording video to a file, the <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> stops the recording.

>*Important:*  The <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> is part of the <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure that "Video Grabber" is selected from the list of script libraries.
