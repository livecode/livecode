Name: revCopyFile

Type: command

Syntax: revCopyFile <fileToCopy>, <folderToCopyTo>

Summary:
Copies a <file>.

Introduced: 1.1.1

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
revCopyFile "/Disk/myfile","/Disk/Folder/"

Example:
revCopyFile "data/settings.txt","olddata"

Example:
revCopyFile the sourceFile of this card, it

Parameters:
fileToCopy:
The fileToCopy specifies the name and location of the file. If you
specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes the file is in the
defaultFolder. 

folderToCopyTo:
The folderToCopyTo specifies the name and location of the folder where
the copied file should be placed. If you specify a name but not a
location, LiveCode assumes the destination folder is in the
defaultFolder. 

The result:
The <revCopyFile> <command> uses system services on each <platform> to
perform the copy. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, it uses <AppleScript>; on
<OS X>, <Windows> and <Unix> systems, it uses the <shell> <function>.
Any errors encountered are <return|returned> in the <result> <function>.

Description:
Use the <revCopyFile> <command> to make a copy of a <file(keyword)> to
another <folder>.

>*Important:*  Use this command to copy a <application bundle|bundle> on
> <OS X|OS X systems>

You can also copy a file using the put <command>, in a <statement> like
the following:

    put URL "binfile:/Disk/myfile" into URL
    "binfile:/Disk/Folder/myfile" 


However, the <revCopyFile> <command> provides certain advantages. It
copies file attributes (such as <type signature|file type>) and <Mac OS>
<resource fork|resource forks> along with the <file(keyword)>. It also
does not require reading the entire <file(keyword)> into memory, so even
extremely large <file(function)|files> can be copied.

>*Note:* In a standalone application the <Common library> is implemented
> as a hidden <group> and made available when the <group> receives its
> first <openBackground> message. During the first part of the
> <application|application's> startup process, before this <message> is
> sent, the <revCopyFile> <command> is not yet available. This may
> affect attempts to use this <command> in <startup>, <preOpenStack>,
> <openStack>, or <preOpenCard> <handler|handlers> in the <main stack>.
> Once the <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is
> available and the <revCopyFile> <command> can be used in any
> <handler>.
