Parameters:
folderToCopy:
The folderToCopy specifies the name and location of the folder. If you
specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes the folder is in the
defaultFolder. 

destinationFolder:
The destinationFolder specifies the name and location of the folder
where the copy will be created. If you specify a name but not a
location, LiveCode assumes the destination folder is in the
defaultFolder. 

The result:
The <revCopyFolder> <command> uses system services on each <platform> to
perform the copy. On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, it uses
<AppleScript>; on <Windows> and <Unix> systems, it uses the <shell>
<function>. Any errors encountered are <return|returned> in the <result>
<function>. 

Description:
Use the <revCopyFolder> <command> to make a copy of a <folder> inside
another <folder>.

The <revCopyFolder> <command> makes a copy of the entire <folder>,
including all <file|files>, <subfolder|subfolders>, and their contents.
The <folder> remains in its original location and the copy is placed in
the new location.

>*Note:* When included in a <standalone application>, the <Common
> library> is implemented as a hidden <group> and made available when
> the <group> receives its first <openBackground> message. During the
> first part of the <application|application's> startup process, before
> this <message> is sent, the <revCopyFolder> <command> is not yet
> available. This may affect attempts to use this <command> in
> <startup>, <preOpenStack>, <openStack>, or
> <preOpenCardhandlers(message)> in the <main stack>. Once the
> <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is available and
> the <revCopyFolder> <command> can be used in any <handler>.

>*Note:* To copy a bundle on Mac OS X systems, use the <revCopyFile
> command> 

>*Note:* On Linux and OS X systems, folder paths can contain the tilde
> (~) character, referring to the current user's home directory. Using
> these chars is not supported by revCopyFolder, and it is necessary to
> replace the tilde with its literal value (eg /home/userName)
