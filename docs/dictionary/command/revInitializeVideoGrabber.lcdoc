Description:
Use the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command> to start up <video capture> capability.

You must use the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command> before using any of the other <command|commands> and <function|functions> in the <Video library>. The <command> does two things:

* Loads the code necessary for video capture into memory.
* Opens the video grabber window.

>*Note:* The <video grabber> is not a <stack window>, so you can't set its <properties>. To change the size and location of the <video grabber>, use the <revSetVideoGrabberRect> <command>.

Once the video grabber is open, you can use the revVideoGrabDialog <command> to specify where the video camera (or other video source) is connected. Use the <revRecordVideo> <command> to record video from the camera to a <file>, or use the <revPreviewVideo> command to display video without saving it.

To use QuickTime for video capture (on Mac OS, OS X, or Windows systems), specify "QT" as the <videoMethod>. To use <VFW|Video for Windows> (on <Windows|Windows systems>), specify "VFW".

To close the window and unload the video capture code, you should use the <revCloseVideoGrabber> <command> when you're done with <video capture>.

>*Important:*  The <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command> is part of the <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure that "Video Grabber" is selected from the list of script libraries.
