Description:
Use the <revMail> <command> to create an email message from within a <stack>.

When LiveCode executes the <revMail> <command>, the user's email program is opened (if necessary) and a new email message with the specified <parameter|parameters> is created. The user can change any of the settings before sending the message, and the message is not sent automatically: the user must explicitly send it (for example, by clicking a 'Mail' button in the email program).

On Mac OS systems, the mail message is opened in the application the user has set for the 'mailto:' protocol in the Internet control panel (or, for older system versions, Internet Config).

On iOS, <revMail> hooks into the iOS MessageUI framework.

* not configured - if the user has turned off or has not setup mail access on their device
* cancel - if the user chooses to cancel the send
* saved - if the user chose to save the message in drafts
* sent - if the user elected to send the email
* failed - if sending the email was attempted, but it failed

>*Important:*  On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, the <revMail> <command> requires that AppleScript be installed and that the GURL <Apple Event> be supported. GURL support is included in <Mac OS> 8.5 or later, and is available for <Mac OS> 8.0 and 8.1 if the Internet Scripting file is installed in the Scripting Additions folder inside the Extensions folder. (This <file> is installed by the Internet Access installer on the 8.0 installation CD.) The <revMail> <command> is not supported for <Mac OS> versions before 8.0.

For some older email programs, it may not be possible to specify a <ccAddress>, <mailSubject>, or <messageBody>. Generally, the <revMail> <command> still works with such programs, but only the 'To:' header is set.

>*Note:*  When included in a <standalone application>, the <Common library> is implemented as a hidden <group> and made available when the <group> receives its first <openBackground> message. During the first part of the <application|application's> startup process, before this <message> is sent, the <revMail> <command> is not yet available. This may affect attempts to use this <command> in <startup>, <preOpenStack>, <openStack>, or <preOpenCard> <handler|handlers> in the <main stack>. Once the <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is available and the <revMail> <command> can be used in any <handler>.

>*Note:* Once the <revMail> command is called, you have no more control over what the user does with the message. They are free to modify the message and the addresses as they see fit.
