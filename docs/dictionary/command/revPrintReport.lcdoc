Name: revPrintReport

Type: command

Syntax: revPrintReport

Summary:
Prints a report from the <report viewer|report viewers> on the 
<current card>. 

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop

Security: printing

Example:
revPrintReport

Description:
Use the <revPrintReport> <command> to print a report that you have set 
up in the <Report Builder>.

>*Note:* The <Report Builder> stack is no-longer supported but can
> still 
> be used by manually launching the tool.

When you use the <Report Builder> to create a set of report settings,
the settings are stored with the card. The <revPrintReport> <command>
uses the settings specified in the <Report Builder> for the 
<current card> to print the report. If you have never used the 
<Report Builder> with the <current card> (and therefore there are no 
report settings to use), the <revPrintReport> <command> causes a 
<error|script error>.

The <revPrintReport> <command> is equivalent to clicking "Print Report"
in the <Report Builder>.

>*Important:*  The <revPrintReport> <command> is part of the 
> <Printing library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure the "Printing" 
> library checkbox is checked.
