Description:
Use the <revRecordVideo> <command> to record a <movie> file.

You must use the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command> to open the <video grabber> before you can use the <revRecordVideo> <command>.

If you specified "QT" as the video method when you executed the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command>, the recorded video is stored in <QuickTime> <format>. If you specified "VFW", the recorded video is stored in <AVI> <format>.

If the video grabber was already recording video to a file, executing the <revRecordVideo> <command> again stops that recording and starts a new one.

>*Important:*  If you are using <QuickTime> for video capture, <execute> the <revVideoGrabIdle> <command> periodically while previewing or recording video. Not doing so may cause the video in the <video grabber> to stutter or display strange screen artifacts

To stop recording the video input, use the <revStopRecordingVideo> <command>.

>*Important:*  The <revRecordVideo> <command> is part of the <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure that "Video Grabber" is selected from the list of script libraries.
