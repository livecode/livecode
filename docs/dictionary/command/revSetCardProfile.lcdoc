stackName:
The short name of an open stack. If you don't specify a stack, the
current card of the topStack is changed. >*Note:* Although the
revSetCardProfile command changes a card, you specify a stack name, not
a card name.

Description:
Use the <revSetCardProfile> <command> to change <property> settings on a
<card> to a different set of stored settings.

>*Note:* Although the <revSetCardProfile> <command> changes a <card>,
> you specify a <stack> name, not a <card> name.

A profile is a set of property settings for an object. You create a
profile for an object, and give it a name, using the Property Profiles
pane in the object's property inspector. When you change that object to
use a profile, the properties you specified in the profile are changed
to the settings you specified. This helps you quickly switch the
appearance and behavior of the <object(glossary)> without needing to set
its <properties> individually.

The <revSetCardProfile> <command> changes the <property profile|profile>
of the <current card> of the specified <stack> and all the
<object|objects> on that <card>. If an <object(glossary)> does not have
a <property profile|profile> with the specified <profileName>, the
<object|object's> <properties> are not changed.

>*Important:*  The <revSetCardProfile> <command> is part of the
> <Profile library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a
> <standalone application>, in the Profiles section on the General
> screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure you
> choose to include profiles in your application.
