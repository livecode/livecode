Name: revSetSpeechPitch

Type: command

Syntax: revSetSpeechPitch <pitchLevel> 

Summary: Sets the pitch (whether the voice is high or low) to be used with <text to speech>.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
revSetSpeechPitch 100

Example:
revSetSpeechPitch (the thumbPosition of scrollbar "Pitch")

Parameters:
pitchLevel (integer): An integer between 30 and 127.

The result: If text to speech is not available on the current system, the <revSetSpeechPitch> <command> sets the <result> <function> to an error message.

Description:
Use the <revSetSpeechPitch> <command> to change the way <text to speech|speech> sounds.

The greater the <pitchLevel>, the higher-pitched the computer is when speaking text with the <revSpeak> <command>. Use a greater <pitchLevel> for a treble voice and a lower <pitchLevel> for a bass voice.

The <pitchLevel> is logarithmically related to the voice frequency: the range 30 to 127 corresponds approximately to the range from 50Hz to 12,000Hz. If you need to convert from Hertz (cycles per second) to the <pitchLevel> numbers used with this <command>, use the following <custom function>:

  function pitchFromHertz theHertzFrequency
    get (ln(theHertzFrequency) - ln(261.625))/ln(1.05946309434)
    return round(60 + it)
  end pitchFromHertz

The pitch specified by the <revSetSpeechPitch> <command> is used for all speeches following the <command> during the current session. If the computer is already speaking when you <execute> the <command>, the new pitch affects the current speech.

>*Important:*  The <revSetSpeechPitch> <command> is part of the <Speech library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "Speech" is selected in the list of script libraries.
