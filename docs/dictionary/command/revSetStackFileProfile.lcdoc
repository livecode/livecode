stackName:
The short name of an open stack. If you don't specify a stack, the stack
file that the topStack belongs to is changed. >*Note:* Although the
revSetStackFileProfile command changes a stack file, you specify a stack
name, not a file name.

Description:
Use the <revSetStackFileProfile> <command> to change <property> settings
throughout a <stack file> to a different set of stored settings.

>*Note:* Although the <revSetStackFileProfile> <command> changes a
> <stack file>, you specify a <stack> name, not a <file> name.

A profile is a set of property settings for an object. You create a
profile for an object, and give it a name, using the Property Profiles
pane in the object's property inspector. When you change that object to
use a profile, the properties you specified in the profile are changed
to the settings you specified. This helps you quickly switch the
appearance and behavior of the <object(glossary)> without needing to set
its <properties> individually.

The <revSetStackFileProfile> <command> changes the current <property
profile|profile> of the specified <stack>, all the <stacks> in the same
<stack file>, and all the <object|objects> in all these <stacks>. If an
<object(glossary)> does not have a <property profile|profile> with the
specified <profileName>, the <object|object's> <properties> are not
changed. 

>*Important:*  The <revSetStackFileProfile> <command> is part of the
> <Profile library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, in the Profiles section on the General 
> screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure you
> choose to include profiles in your application.
