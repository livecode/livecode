Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
