Description:
Use the <revUnloadSpeech> <command> to free up memory when you're done using the <Speech library>.

The operating system loads its text-to-speech software into memory when it's needed by any of the commands and functions in the Speech library. The <revUnloadSpeech> <command> lets you unload this software, freeing up the memory it uses, when you're done.

If your application uses text to speech, you should execute the <revUnloadSpeech> <command> either when your application is finished using <text to speech>, when the <stack> that uses <text to speech|speech> is closed (in a <closeStack> <handler>), or when your application quits (in a <shutdown> <handler>). The <revUnloadSpeech> command must be executed at shutdown if not before in order for the application to close.

>*Important:*  The <revUnloadSpeech> <command> is part of the <Speech library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "Speech" is selected in the list of script libraries.
