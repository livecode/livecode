Name: revUpdateGeometry

Type: command

Syntax: revUpdateGeometry

Summary:
Moves and resizes <object|objects> according to their Geometry pane
settings. 

Associations: geometry library

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
revUpdateGeometry

Example:
if the width of this stack &gt; 100 then revUpdateGeometry

Description:
The LiveCode development environment automatically executes the
<revUpdateGeometry> <command> when a <resizeStack> <message> is sent.
Use the <revUpdateGeometry> <command> if your stack <handle|handles> the
<resizeStack> <message> without passing it.

Normally, you do not need to use the <revUpdateGeometry> <command> at
all, since LiveCode automatically updates geometry when a <stack> is
resized. Use it only if both the following conditions are true:

1. Your stack uses the Geometry pane of the property inspector to
   automate object positioning and sizing when the stack window is
   resized, and


2. Either a handler in your stack locks messages and then moves or
   resizes the stack window, or a resizeStack <handler> in your <stack>
   does not pass the <resizeStack> <message> at the end of the
   <handler>. 


If both these conditions are true, execute the <revUpdateGeometry>
<command> in the <handler>, after the resizing is performed, to perform
Geometry tasks.

>*Important:*  The <revCacheGeometry> <command> is part of the 
> <Geometry library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure the "Geometry" 
> library checkbox is checked.
