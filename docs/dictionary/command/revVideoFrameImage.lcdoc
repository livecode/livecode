Parameters:
frameWidth: A positive integer.

dataVariable: The name of an existing variable.

Description:
Use the <revVideoFrameImage> <command> to capture a single <frame> of video.

The <revVideoFrameImage> <command> <return|returns> <binary file|binary data> in the same <format> as the <imageData> <property> of <image(object)|images>, placing it in the <dataVariable>. To show the captured frame in an image, set the <image(object)|image's> <imageData> <property> to the <value> placed in the <dataVariable>, as in the following example:

  put empty into frameContainer
  revVideoFrameImage 400,300,"frameContainer"
  set the imageData of image "Picture" to frameContainer

If the <frameWidth> and <frameHeight> are not the same as the width and height of the <video grabber|video grabber window>, the frame is scaled before being returned by the <revVideoFrameImage> <function>. The data <return|returned> by the <command> always uses the <frameWidth> and <frameHeight>, even if this means the video must be stretched or shrunk to fit. For example, if the <video grabber|video grabber window> is 100 x 100 <pixels>, but you specify 200 as the <frameWidth> and 100 as the <frameHeight>, the <return|returned> data fits an <image(keyword)> 200 x 100 <pixels>, with the horizontal dimension stretched to fit.

>*Important:*  The <revVideoFrameImage> <command> is part of the <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure that "Video Grabber" is selected from the list of script libraries.
