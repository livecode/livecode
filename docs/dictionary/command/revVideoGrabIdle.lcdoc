Description:
Use the <revVideoGrabIdle> <command> to avoid display problems during <video capture>.

When using QuickTime for video capture, you need to execute the <revVideoGrabIdle> command periodically in order to let <QuickTime> update the display. (Not doing so may cause the video in the <video grabber> to stutter or display strange screen artifacts.) If you have issued the <revPreviewVideo> or <revRecordVideo> <command>, be sure to call the <revVideoGrabIdle> <command> periodically until you stop previewing or recording video.

There is no specific interval to use between calls to <revVideoGrabIdle>. If you are seeing jittering or strange artifacts in the <video grabber> window, try decreasing the interval and calling <revVideoGrabIdle> more often.

>*Note:* If you specified "VFW" or "directx" as the video method when you executed the <revInitializeVideoGrabber> <command>, you don't need to call <revVideoGrabIdle>. If the <video capture> is using <VFW|Video for Windows>, the <revVideoGrabIdle> <command> is ignored and has no effect. You need to call <revVideoGrabIdle> only if you specified "QT" as the video method.

>*Important:*  The <revVideoGrabIdle> <command> is part of the <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure that "Video Grabber" is selected from the list of script libraries.
