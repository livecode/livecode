Description:
Use the <revVideoGrabSettings> command to store video-capture settings
you specify in the video capture dialog box.

The revVideoFrameImage command returns binary data, placing it in the
<dataVariable>. 

You specify settings for video capture in the video capture dialog box,
which is displayed by the <revVideoGrabDialog> command. You can get the
current settings with the <revVideoGrabSettings> command and restore
them later with the revSetVideoGrabSettings command. This allows you to
make changes to the video-capture settings under script control.

The value returned by the <revVideoGrabSettings> command consists of
binary data and is not human-readable, but you can store it in a file or
custom property and restore your settings later using the
revSetVideoGrabSettings command.

>*Important:*  The <revVideoGrabSettings> command works only for
> QuickTime video capture. If you are capturing video with Video for
> Windows, the <revVideoGrabSettings> command does not return a
> meaningful value.

>*Important:*  The <revVideoGrabSettings> <command> is part of the 
> <Video library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure the
> "Video Grabber" 
> library checkbox is checked.

Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
