Description:
Use the <revXMLRPC_SetSocket> <function> to set the network socket used in the execution of an <XML-RPC request>.
By default, XML-RPC uses the <post command> to execute an <XML-RPC request>, but this has the overhead of opening and closing a new socket every time. You can avoid this by re-using an already opened <socket>.

If the <revXMLRPC_SetSocket> <command> encounters an error, it <return|returns> an error message starting with "xmlrpcerr"..

>*Important:*  The <revXMLRPC_SetSocket> <command> is part of the <XML-RPC library>. To ensure that the <command> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "XML-RPC Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.
