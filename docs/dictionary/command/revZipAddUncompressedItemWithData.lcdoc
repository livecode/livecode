Description:
Use the <revZipAddUncompressedItemWithData> command to put data from a LiveCode variable into a file in a zip archive without compressing the data. The archive must have first been opened with <revZipOpenArchive>. This command is useful if data is being placed into an archive simply to package it up neatly, rather than to reduce the size of the data. Using <revZipAddUncompressedItemWithData> to add items to archives is generally faster than using the <revZipAddItemWithData command>, which compresses the data.
