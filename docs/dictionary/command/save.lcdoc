Example:

Example:
save stack "MyOldApp" with format 7.0

Parameters:
stack: Any open stack.

filePath: The <filePath> specifies the name and location of the file you want to save to. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes the file is in the <defaultFolder>. If the file does not exist, LiveCode creates it.

stackFormat: The <stack version|stack file format version> to use when saving.

The result: If the stack cannot be saved (for example, if you try to save it to a nonexistent drive or to a CD-ROM), the <result> will contain an error message.  Otherwise, the <result> will be empty.

Description:
Use the <save> <command> to save changes to a <stack> or to save a copy of a <stack> into another <file>.

The <save> <command> saves all <stacks> stored in the same <file> as the specified <stack>. That is, if you save a <main stack>, all <substacks> of that stack are also saved in the same <file>, and if you save a <substack>, its <main stack> and any other <substacks> are also saved.

If the stack has not yet been saved and doesn't have a filename, you must use the `as` form.

You cannot save to a standalone application's file; <standalone application|standalones> are read-only.

The <save> command can save the <stack> in several different versions of the LiveCode stack file format.

* If you use the `with newest format` form of the <save> command, the <stack> is saved using the newest <stack version>
* If you use the `with format` form of the <save> command, the <stackFormat> should be the particular <stack version> you want the stack to be saved as.
* If you do not specify a format to use, the current value of the <stackFileFormat> property is used.

**Warning:** If you save in an older <stack version> that doesn't support all of the features used in the stack, then some of contents of the stack may be lost.  In general, you are recommended to use the `with newest format` form of the <save> command.
