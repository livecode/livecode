Name: secure socket

Type: command

Syntax: secure socket <socket> [without verification]

Syntax: secure socket <socket> [with verification [for host <verificationHostName>]]

Summary: Secures an open socket.

Introduced: 6.6

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,mobile

Security: network

Example:
secure socket "livecode.com:443"

Example:
open socket to "127.0.0.0:8080"
write "unencrypted message" to socket "127.0.0.0:8080"
secure socket "127.0.0.0:8080"
write "encrypted message" to socket "127.0.0.0:8080"

Example:
secure socket mySocket with verifcation for host "livecode.com"

Parameters:
socket: A reference to an open socket.
verificationHostName: The IP address or domain name of the host you want to verify against.

Description:
Use the secure socket command to secure an open socket.

If 'with verification' is specified, when connecting to a remote peer, the client verifies the peers certificate during the handshake process. The <sslCertificates property> can be used to specify a list of certificates to verify against. In addition you can place system wide certificates in System/Library/OpenSSL/certs. If a verificationhostname is specified, the socket will be verified against that verificationhostname. An example of this is when you want to create a secure connection with a host while tunnelling through a proxy. Specifying the final host allows LiveCode to verify the socket against that host, rather than the proxy server.

If 'without verification' is specified then peers credentials are not authenticated, and any connection is accepted.

Once secured:
* All pending and future reads from the socket will be assumed to be encrypted.
* All pending writes will complete unencrypted. All future writes will be encrypted.

If the socket fails secure, a <socketError message> is sent to the object that opened the socket (not the object that attempted to secure it).

>*Important:*  The secure secure socket command is part of the SSL & Encryption library. To ensure that the command works in a standalone application, you must include this custom library when you create your standalone. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the Standalone Application Settings window, make sure "SSL & Encryption" is selected in the list of script libraries.
