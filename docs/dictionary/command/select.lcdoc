the selected chunk.

Use the select before or select after form to position the insertion
point at a particular location in a field.

Use the select empty form to deselect all objects and text. To select an
object without deselecting any objects that are already selected, use
the selected <property> instead of the <select> <command>.

To select lines in a list field, set the field's hilitedLine <property>
instead of using the <select> <command>.

To change the selection in an option menu or combo box use the  property
instead of the command.

To select text in a field, the field's traversalOn <property> must be
set to true.
