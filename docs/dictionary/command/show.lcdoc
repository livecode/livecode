Description:
Use the <show> <command> to show invisible <object|objects>.

Showing an object sets its visible <property> to true. You can also set
the <showInvisibles> <property> to true to override the <visible>
<property> and show all <object|objects>.

You can show a card without causing a script error, but doing so has no
effect. 

Showing a group shows all the controls in the group whose visible
<property> is true.
