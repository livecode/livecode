Name: start editing

Type: command

Syntax: start editing <group> [of <stack>]

Summary:
Puts a <stack> into group-editing mode.

Associations: group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
start editing group "container"

Parameters:
group:
A reference to a group you want to edit.

stack:
A reference to the stack that contains the group you want to edit.

Description:
Use the <start editing> <command> to add <object|objects> to a
<group(command)> or change the <object|objects> in a <group(command)>.

If you don't specify a <stack>, the specified <group(command)> in the
<current stack> is put into group-editing mode.

Any objects created while in group-editing mode are added to that group.

When a group is in group-editing mode, font and color properties for the
group (though not for objects in the group) are disregarded. This means
that if properties such as textFont, <foregroundColor>, and so on are
set for the <group(command)>, it displays differently when in
group-editing mode, using the fonts and colors of the <stack> the
<group(command)> is in. As soon as you exit group-editing mode with the
<stop editing> <command>, the <group(glossary)|group's> correct
appearance is restored.

>*Note:* The <start editing> <command> temporarily modifies the <object
> hierarchy>, displaying only the <object|objects> that belong to the
> <group(command)> being edited. <inheritance|Inherited> font and color
> <properties> may not appear correctly while the <group(command)> is
> being edited, but will be restored whhen you exit group-editing mode.
> Also, if the <start editing> <command> is included in a <handler>,
> using the <debugger> to step through that <handler> may cause
> unexpected results because of the change in object context.
