If no session identifier is specified by the <sessionId> <property> or

with a unique identifier, and the contents of the session cookie set to
that identifier.

The location where the <$_SESSION(keyword)> array is stored on the
server is configured using the <sessionSavePath> <property>.

A session is stored until it expires or is deleted using the <delete
session command>. The maximum age of a session is configured using the
<sessionLifetime> <property>.

> to start and use sessions. They provide a way for advanced users to
> configure the way session work.

>*Warning:* Session properties cannot be changed once a session has been
> created.
