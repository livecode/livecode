Description:
Use the <topLevel> <command> to display a <stack> in an <editable window>.

An editable window can be resized (if its resizable <property> is true), and its <control|controls> can be <selected>, moved, and changed.  To edit a <stack> of a different style (a <palette>, <modeless>, or <modal dialog box|modal dialog>), use the <topLevel> <command> to display it in an <editable window>.

The <topLevel> <command> closes the <stack> and reopens it as an <editable window>, so <closeStack> and <openStack>, <closeCard> and <openCard>, and (if applicable) <closeBackground> and <openBackground> <message|messages> are sent to the <current card> as a result of <execute|executing> this <command>. Use the <lock messages> <command> before executing <topLevel> if you want to prevent these <message|messages> from being sent.

If the stack is already in an editable window, the <topLevel> <command> does not close and reopen it.
