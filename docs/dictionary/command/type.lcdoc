Description:
Use the <type> command to show text appearing in a <field> at typing pace or to send keyboard <event|events> to a <stack>.

The <type> <command> sends a <rawKeyDown> and <rawKeyUp> message to the <current card> for each <character> typed.

The type command does not automatically place an insertion point in a field, so if you want to simulate typing into a field, you must first use the select command to place the insertion point:

  select after field "Data"
  type "Hello"

The speed at which characters are typed is controlled by the <typingRate> <property>. To quickly put text into a <field> without delay, use the <put> <command> instead.

>*Note:* To type text into a <field>, you must first place the <insertion point> in the <field> using the <select> or <click> <command>.

>*Note:* As the <type> command is designed to emulate exactly what happens when a user types a key on the keyboard, the <rawKeyDown>, <keyDown>, <rawKeyUp> and <keyUp> messages are sent by the command. If these messages are blocked, the text will not appear in the selected field.
