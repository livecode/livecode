Example:
undo

Description:
The undo command undoes the last action performed by the user. Undoable actions include:
	* Using the paint tools
	* Deleting controls by selecting them with the Pointer tool and pressing Delete
	* Moving controls with the Pointer tool
	* Editing actions (such as typing, cutting, and pasting) in a field

The undo command cannot be used to undo actions performed by a script. Only user actions can be undone. For example, if you use a script to change the text in a field, the undo command cannot reverse that change, but if the user edits text, you can use undo to reverse the action.

If you use the undo command twice in succession, the second undo undoes the first one.

The undo command is equivalent to choosing Edit menuUndo.
Use the <undo> command to give the user an opportunity to reverse a horrible mistake.
