Name: unload

Type: command

Syntax: unload [URL] <cachedURL>

Summary:
Removes a <file> that was placed in the local <cache> by the <load>
<command>, or cancels a <download> or <upload> in progress.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, html5

Platforms: desktop, server

Security: network

Example:
unload URL "http://www.example.com"

Example:
unload URL (line 1 of the cachedURLs)

Example:
unload URL "ftp://ftp.example.org/newfiles/latest.txt"

Parameters:
cachedURL:
Any URL in the cachedURLs or any URL whose transfer was started with the
libURLftpUpload, libURLftpUploadFile, or libURLDownloadToFile command.

The result:
If the <cachedURL> is not in the <cache> and not currently being
<upload|uploaded> or <download|downloaded>, the <result> <function> is
set to "can't find url".

Description:
Use the <unload> <command> to release memory used by a <cache|cached>
<URL(keyword)> when you no longer need it.

If the <cachedURL> is still being <download|downloaded> with the <load>
<command>, the <unload> command cancels the <download>.

The <unload> <command> can be used to cancel any <non-blocking> <FTP> or
<HTTP> file transfer in progress, but it does not cancel file transfers
that were initiated by using a <URL(keyword)> <container> in an
<expression> or by putting something into a <URL(keyword)>.

The <unload> <command> removes the <cachedURL> from the <URLStatus>
<function>. This includes <URL(glossary)|URLs> that have been
<upload|uploaded> with the <libURLftpUpload> <command>, as well as those
that have been <cache|cached> with the <load> <command>.

>*Note:* You can use a <URL(keyword)> with the <URL(keyword)> <keyword>
> even after it has been unloaded from the <cache>, but <cache|caching>
> speeds up access to the <URL(keyword)>.
