   write "test" to socket "www.google.com:80" with message "socketFinishedWriting"
end mouseUp
      
on socketFinishedWriting pSocketID
   put "Data written to socket" && pSocketID

end socketFinishedWriting

Parameters:
value (string): 
socket: 
callbackMessage: The name of a message to be sent to the current object when the write is successfully completed.
socketID: The identifier (set when you opened the socket) of the socket you want to send data to. The socket identifier starts with the IP address of the host the socket is connected to, and may optionally include a port number (separated from the IP address by a colon). If there is more than one socket connected to that host and port, you can specify which socket by appending the connection name or number that was assigned when the socket was opened, separated from the port number by a vertical bar (|).

Description:
Use the <write to socket> <command> to send data to another system via a <TCP> <socket>.

If you specify a <callbackMessage>, as soon as the write is finished, the specified <message> is sent to the <object> whose <script> contains the <write to socket> <command>. The <callbackMessage> is sent with one <parameter>, which is the <socketID>.

If you don't specify a <callbackMessage>, the <handler> pauses until the write has been completed, or until the time set in the <socketTimeoutInterval> <property> has passed.
