Example:
read from file myData until CRLF

Example:

Description:
Use the <CRLF> <constant> as an easier-to-read substitute for numToChar(13) & numToChar(10).

The <CRLF> <constant> is needed because you can't type the <characters> it represents in a <script>.

The line feed character is the standard end-of-line delimiter on Unix systems. The end-of-line delimiter for Mac OS systems is a carriage return, and the end-of-line delimiter for Windows systems is a carriage return followed by a line feed.
