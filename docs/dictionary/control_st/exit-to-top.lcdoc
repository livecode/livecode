Example:

Description:
Use the <exit to top> <control structure> to stop <execute|executing>
the current <handler> and suppress pending <message|messages>. Form:The
<exit to top> <statement> appears on a line by itself, anywhere inside a
<handler>. 

Usually, <exit to top> is used within an <if> <control structure>, so
that <execute|execution> stops if a condition is true and continues if
the condition is false.

You can use an <exit to top> <statement> in a <message handler>,
<function handler>, <getProp handler>, or <setProp handler>.

If the current handler was called from another handler, the calling
handler is also halted. Other messages that depend on the same action
are also suppressed: for example, if an <exit to top> <control
structure> is executed in a <closeCard> <handler>, the corresponding
<openCard> <message> is not sent to the destination <card>.

>*Important:*  When a <handler> <execute|executes> an <exit to top>
> <statement>, the <message>, setProp <trigger>, <function call>, or
> <getProp call> is not <pass|passed> to the next <object(glossary)> in
> the <message path>. To halt the current <handler> and <pass> the
> <message>, <trigger>, or <call> to the next <object(glossary)> in the
> <message path>, use the <pass> <control structure> instead of <exit>
> or <exit to top>.
