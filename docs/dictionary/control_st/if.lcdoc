Name: if

Type: control structure

Syntax:
if <condition> then
   <statementList>
[else
   <elseStatementList>]
end if

Syntax:if <condition> then
   <statementList>
 [else if <condition> then
   <elseifStatementList>]
 [else 
   <elseStatementList>]
end if


Summary:
Evaluates a <condition|conditional expression> to determine if it is true
and if so <execute|executes> a subsequent <statement> or <statementlist|statement list>.

If the <conditional expression|condition> is false and the <if> <control structure> contains
an <else> keyword the <statement> or <statementlist|statement list> following the <else>
<keyword> is executed.

The <if> <control structure> may contain one or more <else if> <keyword|keywords> which have a
<condition|conditional expression>. If the <condition|conditional expression> for one of these evaluates to be
true then the <statment|statement> or <statementlist|statement list> following that <else if>
<keyword> is executed. 

If the <if> <control structure> contains
more than one line then the <if> <control structure> must end with an <end if> keyword.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
if tSpeed &lt; 2 then
   answer "That is slow"
else if tSpeed &lt; 5 then
   answer "That is pretty fast"
else if tSpeed &lt; 10 then
   answer "That is a rocket"
else
   answer "You are traveling at the speed of light"
end if

Parameters:
condition (bool):
Any <expression>. (If the <condition> <evaluate|evaluates> to true, 
the <statement|statements> execute for that <condition>.
If the <condition> <evaluate|evaluates> to false, the <statement> or 
<statementlist|statement list> following that <condition> is
skipped.)

statementList:
Of one or more <LiveCode> <statement|statements>, and can also include
<if>, <switch>, <try>, or <repeat> <control structure|control
structures>. 

elseIfStatementList:
Of one or more <LiveCode> <statement|statements>, and can also include
<if>, <switch>, <try>, or <repeat> <control structure|control
structures>. 

elseStatementList:
Of one or more <LiveCode> <statement|statements>, and can also include
<if>, <switch>, <try>, or <repeat> <control structure|control
structures>. 

Description:
Use the <if> <control structure> to <execute> a <statement>
(or <statementlist|list of statements>) only under certain circumstances. 

The <if> <control structure> always begins with the word if. There
are four forms of the <if> <control structure>:

    if condition then statementList [else elseStatementList]

This form may have a line break before the words `then` or `else` or both.

    if condition then
       statementList 
    [else
       elseStatementList]
    end if
    
    -- OR
    if condition 
    then statement 
    [else
       elseStatementList]
    end if

    -- OR
    if condition then
       statementList 
    else elseStatement
    end if

If the <condition> <evaluate|evaluates> to true, the statement or
<statementList> is <execute|executed>; if the <condition>
<evaluate|evaluates> to false, the statement or <statementList> is
skipped. 

if the <condition> evaluates to false and the <if> <control structure>
contains an <else> <keyword>, the <elseStatement> or <elseStatementList>
which follows it is <execute|executed>.

If the <if> <control structure> contains one or more <else if>
<keyword|keywords> which have a <condition|conditional expression>,
and one of those <condition|conditional expressions> evaluates to be
true, then the respective <elseIfstatement|else if statement> or
<elseIfstatementlist|else if statement list> following that
<else if> <keyword> is executed.

If one <if> <control structure> is nested inside another, use of the
second form described above is recommended, since the other forms may
cause ambiguities in interpreting which <else> clause belongs with which
<if> statement.

The <if> <control structure> is most suitable when you want to check a
single <condition>. If you need to check for multiple possibilities,
doing something different for each one, use 
a <switch> <control structure> instead.

>*Note:* The <if> <control structure> is implemented internally as a
> <command> and appears in the <commandNames>.
