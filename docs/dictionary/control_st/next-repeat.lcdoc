Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Description:
Use the <next repeat> <control structure> to skip part of a <repeat> loop.

Form:
The <next repeat> <statement> appears on a line by itself, anywhere inside a <repeat> <control structure>.

The <next repeat> <control structure> skips the rest of the current <iteration>, and continues to the next <iteration>. The following example performs the loop action only if the <current card|current card's> name contains the letter "e":

  repeat for the number of cards of this stack
    go to next card
    if "e" is in the short name of this card then next repeat
    put the short name of this card & return after myCardsList
  end repeat

Usually, <next repeat> is used within an <if> <control structure>, so that the current <iteration> is skipped if a condition is true and continues if the condition is false.
