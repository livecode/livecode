Parameters:
encodedArray (array): A binary string representing an array, as returned by the arrayEncode function.

Description:
Use the <arrayDecode> function to rebuild an array from an encoded string produced by the <arrayEncode function>. 

Encoding and decoding arrays is designed to allow arrays to be written to a file on disk, or sent across a network. See the <arrayEncode> reference for more information on doing this.

>*Note:* It is possible for two different strings to produce the same array. This is due to arrays having a different ordering of <keys>. To see if two encoded arrays are equal, first decode them back into the original array, then directly compare them using the <= operator.>
