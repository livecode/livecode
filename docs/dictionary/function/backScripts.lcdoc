the backScripts

if the long ID of me is not among the lines of the backScripts then beep

Returns: The <backScripts> function returns a list of the long ID property of all objects that have been inserted into the back, one ID per line.

Description:
Use the <backScripts> function to find out which scripts receive messages and function calls after the current object, the objects that own the current object, and any stacks in the stacksInUse.

A script inserted into the back with the <insert script> command receives messages after all objects in the message path, just before the application itself receives the message.

If more than one object is in the <backScripts>, their order in the message path is the same as their order in the list. For example, the first object in the <backScripts> receives messages before the second object. This order is the reverse of the order in which the objects were added with the <insert script> command.
