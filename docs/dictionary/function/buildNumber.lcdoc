Description:
Use the <buildNumber> <function> to determine which <engine> version the
<application> is using. This is useful to figure out, for example,
whether a certain <LiveCode> feature is available.

The <buildNumber> of two copies of LiveCode or a <standalone
application> may be different, even if the <version> function
<return|returns> the same number. This is because new builds of the same
version may be released to provide fixes to specific problems.

When reporting a problem with LiveCode, please include the <buildNumber>
and <version> of the <application>.
