The <buildNumber> of two copies of LiveCode or a <standalone application> may be different, even if the <version> function <return|returns> the same number. This is because new builds of the same version may be released to provide fixes to specific problems.

When reporting a problem with LiveCode, please include the <buildNumber> and <version> of the <application>.
