Returns: The <cachedURLs> <function> <return|returns> a list of currently <load|loaded> <URL|URLs>, one per <line>.

Description:
Use the <cachedURLs> <function> to determine which <files> have been <download|downloaded> and are currently in the <cache>. A <cache|cached> <URL(keyword)> can be accessed more quickly than one that is not <cache|cached>.

The <cachedURLs> <function> includes all <URL(glossary)|URLs> that you have successfully <load|loaded> with the <load> <command>. If an unsuccessful attempt has been made to <load> a <URL(keyword)>, it does not appear in the <cachedURLs>. Only <URL(glossary)|URLs> whose <URLStatus> is "cached" appear in the <cachedURLs>.

Cached files consume memory. To release this memory after you are finished with a URL, use the <unload> <command> to remove it from the <cache>. You can use this <handler> to unload all <URL(glossary)|URLs>:

  on unloadAll
    repeat for each line thisURL in the cachedURLs
      unload URL thisURL
    end repeat
  end unloadAll

>*Important:*  The <cachedURLs> <function> is part of the <Internet library>. To ensure that the <function> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "Internet Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.

Changes:
The URLStatus function became part of the Internet library in version 1.1. In previous versions, it was not a library function.
