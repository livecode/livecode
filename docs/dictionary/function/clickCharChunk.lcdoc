Name: clickCharChunk

Type: function

Syntax: the clickCharChunk

Syntax: clickCharChunk()

Summary:
<return|Returns> the position of the <character> the user last clicked
in a <field>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, mobile

Example:
the clickCharChunk

Example:
if word 2 of the clickCharChunk &lt; 100 then put the clickChar into me

Returns:
The <clickCharChunk> <function> <return|returns> a <chunk expression> of
the form char charNumber to charNumber of field fieldNumber.

Description:
Use the <clickCharChunk> <function> within a <mouseDown>, <mouseUp>, or
<selectionChanged> <handler> to determine where in the text the user
clicked, in order to provide <hypertext> (clickable text) or take some
action based on the click.

The <clickCharChunk> <function> is cleared at the next mouse click, as
as after some editing actions such as deleting text. If the last click
was not in a <field>, the <clickCharChunk> <function> <return|returns>
empty. 

The charNum is the <character> the <mouse pointer> was over when the
mouse was clicked. Moving the mouse before the <mouse button> is
released does not affect the <value> <return|returned> by the
<clickCharChunk>. 

The first and second character numbers in the return value are always
identical, unless the click was on a field but there was no text under
it. In this case, the <clickCharChunk> <return|returns> a <chunk
expression> of the form char charNumber to charNumber - 1 of field
fieldNumber indicating the start of the clickLine. For example, if the
mouse is over an empty <field>, the <clickCharChunk> <return|returns>
char 1 to 0 of field fieldNumber.

If the field is locked, the <clickCharChunk> <function> is most useful
within a <handler> (such as <mouseDown> or <mouseUp>) that is
<trigger|triggered> by the mouse click.

If the field is unlocked, mouseDown and <mouseUp> <message|messages> are
not sent when the user clicks in the <field> (unless the user
right-clicks or holds down the Control key while clicking). Use the
<clickCharChunk> function within a <selectionChanged> <handler> to
determine what <characters> the user is editing in an <unlock|unlocked>
<field>. 

To get the actual character clicked, use the <clickChar> <function>.
