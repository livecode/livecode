The date form returns the month number, the day of the month, and the last two digits of the year, separated by slashes (/).

The short date form returns the same value as the date form.

The abbreviated date form returns the first three letters of the day of the week, a comma, the first three letters of the month, a space, the day of the month, a comma, and the year.

The long date form returns the day of the week, a comma, the name of the month, a space, the day of the month, a comma, and the year.

        * the three-letter abbreviation for the month name
        * the four-digit year

Description:
Use the <date> <function> to display the current date to the user, or to store the date for later use.

The format of the system date forms is set by the Date & Time control panel (on Mac OS systems), the Date control panel (on Windows systems), or the LANG environment variable (on Unix systems).

Changes:
The ability to use the date format preferred by the user was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the date function, along with the time function, consistently used the standard U.S. format, even if the operating system's settings specified another language or date format.
