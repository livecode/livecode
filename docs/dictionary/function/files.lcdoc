Parameters:
targetFolder (String):
The folder path to search.

outputKind (enum):
- empty: Use the short form
- "detailed": Use the long/detailed form

Returns (String):
A list of file names or file information, with one
file per line.

Description:
<Return(glossary)> a list of <file|files> in the <targetFolder>, with
one file per line.  If no <targetFolder> is specified, list the files
in the <current folder>.

<folder(glossary)|Folders> are not included in the list.  To get a
list of folders, use the <folders> function.

<alias|Aliases> (on OS X systems), <symbolic links|symbolic links> (on
Linux systems) and <shortcut|shortcuts> (on Windows systems) are
included in the list only if they refer to a <file>.

> *Note:* The order that files are listed is platform-dependent.  The
> order may vary between <platform|platforms>, between filesystems,
> and even between consecutive calls to the <files> function.  If you
> need a sorted list, use the <sort> command.

### Short form

When the <files> is called as a <function>, or without the `<long>` or
`<long|detailed>` modifiers, it <return(glossary)|returns> only the <file>
names as a string with one file name per line.

> *Note:* On some <platform|platforms>, file names are permitted to
> include the <return(constant)|linefeed> character.  Such a file name
> would be split across more than one line of the string returned by
> the <files> <function>.

### Long form

`the <long> files` and `the <long|detailed> files` are synonyms.  When 
the <files> <function> is called in this form, the <return(glossary)>
value is a list of files with detailed file attributes.

Each line in the return value is a comma-separated list of file
attributes, as follows:

1. **Name**.  The file name is URL-encoded.  To obtain the name as
   plain text, use the <URLDecode> function.
2. **Size**, in bytes.  On OS X systems, this is the size of the <data
   fork>.
3. **Resource fork size**, in bytes.  (OS X only).
4. **Creation date**, in seconds.  (OS X and Windows only).
5. **Last modification date**, in seconds.
6. **Last access date**, in seconds.
7. **Last backup date**, in seconds.
8. **User owner**.  (Linux and OS X only).
9. **Group owner**.  (Linux and OS X only).
10. **Permissions**. (Linux and OS X only; see note).
11. **Creator and <fileType|file type>**.  (OS X only).


Any attribute that is not relevant to the current <platform> is left
empty.

The access permissions consist of three octal digits, in the same form
used for the <umask> property.

> *Note:* On Windows, the permissions are always reported as "777".

Changes:
The <long> form was introduced in version 1.1.
The optional <targetFolder> argument for the function call form was
introduced in version 8.1.
