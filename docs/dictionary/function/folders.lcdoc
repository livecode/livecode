Parameters:
targetFolder (String):
The folder path to search.

outputKind (enum):
- empty: Use the short form
- "detailed": Use the long/detailed form

Returns (String):
A list of folder names or folder information, with
one file per line.

Description:
<Return(glossary)> a list of <folder(glossary)|folders> in the
<targetFolder>, with one file per line.  If no <targetFolder> is
specified, list the files in the <current folder>.

The list only includes folders at the top level of the <target folder>.
The <folders> <function> does not recursively enter and examine
folders deeper in the filesystem.  To examine the contents of a
<subfolder|subfolders>, either pass its path as the <targetFolder>, or
temporarily set the <defaultFolder>.

<file(glossary)|Files> are not included in the list.  To get a list of
files, use the <files> function.

<alias|Aliases> (on OS X systems), <symbolic links|symbolic links> (on
Linux systems) and <shortcut|shortcuts> (on Windows systems) are
included in the list only if they refer to a <folder>.

> *Important:* The list returned by the <folders> contain a ".." entry
> representing the link to the parent folder. Care must be taken to
> filter this entry out to prevent infinite loops and security
> vulnerabilities.

> *Note:* The order that folders are listed is platform-dependent.
> The order may vary between <platform|platforms>, between
> filesystems, and even between consecutive calls to the <folders>
> function.  If you need a sorted list, use the <sort> command.

### Short form

When the <folders> is called as a <function>, or without the `<long>` or
`<long|detailed>` modifiers, it <return(glossary)|returns> only the <folder>
names as a string with one file name per line.

> *Note:* On some <platform|platforms>, folder names are permitted to
> include the <return(constant)|linefeed> character.  Such a folder
> name would be split across more than one line of the string returned
> by the <folders> <function>.

### Long form

`the <long> folders` and `the <long|detailed> folders` are synonyms.  When 
the <folders> <function> is called in this form, the <return(glossary)>
value is a list of folders with detailed file attributes.  Several of
the attributes are provided only for compatibility with the <files>
<function> and do not have any meaning for a <folder>.

Each line in the return value is a comma-separated list of file
attributes, as follows:

1. **Name**.  The folder name is URL-encoded.  To obtain the name as
   plain text, use the <URLDecode> function.
2. **Size**, in bytes.  This is always 0.
3. **Resource fork size**, in bytes.  This is always 0.
4. **Creation date**, in seconds.  (OS X and Windows only).
5. **Last modification date**, in seconds.
6. **Last access date**, in seconds.
7. **Last backup date**, in seconds.
8. **User owner**.  (Linux and OS X only).
9. **Group owner**.  (Linux and OS X only).
10. **Permissions**. (Linux and OS X only; see note).
11. **Creator and <fileType|file type>**.  (OS X only).


Any attribute that is not relevant to the current <platform> is left
empty.

The access permissions consist of three octal digits, in the same form
used for the <umask> property.

> *Note:* On Windows, the permissions are always reported as "777".

The creator and file type are always "????????".

Changes:
The <long> form was introduced in version 1.1.
The optional <targetFolder> argument for the function call form was
introduced in version 8.1.
