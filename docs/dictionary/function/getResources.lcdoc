Name: getResources

Type: function

Syntax: getResources(<filePath> [, <resourceType>])

Summary:
<return|Returns> a list of the <resource|resources> in a <Mac OS>
<file>. 

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac

Platforms: desktop

Security: disk

Example:
getResources("Project Resources")

Example:
getResources(it,"STR#")

Parameters:
filePath:
The location and name of the file whose resource fork you want to list.
If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes the file is
in the defaultFolder.

resourceType:
The 4-character type of the resources you want to list. If you don't
specify a resourceType, the getResources function lists all the
resources of all resource types.

Returns (enum):
The <getResources> <function> <return|returns> a list of
<resource|resources>, one per <line>. Each <line> consists of four
<items> :

        - the resource ID
        - the resource name
        - the resource size in bytes

S       System heap
U       Purgeable
L       Locked
P       Protected
R       Preload
C       Compressed resource
If a flag is set to true, its character is included in the last item. If
the flag is set to false, its character is not included. If none of
these flags is set for a resource, the last item of that resource's line
is empty. If the file does not contain any resources, the <getResources>
<function> <return|returns> empty

-   the 4: character resource type
-   one or more resource flag characters. The possible resource flags
    are as follows:


The result:
If the <filePath> does not exist, the <result> is set to
"can't find file". If the <filePath> exists, but the <file> has no
<resource fork>, the <result> is set to "can't open resource fork". If
the file has a resource fork but no <resource|resources>, the <result>
is empty.

Description:
Use the <getResources> <function> to find out whether a <resource>
already exists before using it or copying it.

Changes:
The order of items returned by the getResources function was changed in
version 1.1. In previous versions, the getResources function returned
these items for each resource:
