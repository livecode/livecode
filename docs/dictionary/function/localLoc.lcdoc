Name: localLoc

Type: function

Syntax: the localLoc of <globalPoint> 

Syntax: localLoc(<globalPoint>)

Summary: <return|Returns> the equivalent, in <relative coordinates|local coordinates>, of a <point> given in <absolute coordinates|global coordinates>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
localLoc((90,174))

Example:
localLoc(the location of field 1)

Parameters:
globalPoint: 
point: Any expression that evaluates to a point--a vertical and horizontal distance from the top left of the screen, separated by a comma.

Returns: The <localLoc> <function> <return|returns> two <integer|integers> separated by a comma.

Description:
Use the <localLoc> <function> to translate between screen and <relative coordinates|window coordinates>.

In window coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the stack window. In screen coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the screen.

The point returned by the <localLoc> <function> is relative to the top left of the <current stack>.

The first item of the returned value is the horizontal distance in pixels from the left edge of the current stack to the location given by <point>.  The second <item> of the <return value|returned value> is the vertical distance from the top edge of the <current stack> to the location given by <point>.
