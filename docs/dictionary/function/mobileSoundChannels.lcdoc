Use the <mobileSoundChannels> function to get a list of the sound channels that currently exist.

Sound channels persist after any sounds have finished playing on them, retaining the last volume setting. To remove a channel from memory completely use the <mobileDeleteSoundChannel> command.

Sound channels only consume system resources when they are playing sounds, this means you don't need to be concerned about having many around at once (assuming most are inactive).
