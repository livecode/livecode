Name: revAppVersion

Type: function

Syntax: revAppVersion()

Summary: <return|Returns> the version of the LiveCode application.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
revAppVersion()

Example:
if revAppVersion() is not "1.0" then answer "Sorry, Charlie!"

Returns: The <revAppVersion> <function> returns a <string> indicating the version of the <development environment>.

Description:
Use the <revAppVersion> <function> if you need to check which version of the <development environment> is currently running.

The <revAppVersion> <function> is different from the <version> <function>. The <revAppVersion> function returns the version of the <development environment>, while the <version> <function> returns the version of the underlying <engine>. For example, the contents of the LiveCode menu bar, the <LiveCode custom libraries>, and the <property inspector> depend on the <revAppVersion>, but the features of the <LiveCode> language depend on the <engine> <version>.

>*Note:* In a standalone application the <Common library> is implemented as a hidden <group> and made available when the <group> receives its first <openBackground> message. During the first part of the <application|application's> startup process, before this <message> is sent, the <revAppVersion> <function> is not yet available. This may affect attempts to use this <function> in <startup>, <preOpenStack>, <openStack>, or <preOpenCard> <handler|handlers> in the <main stack>. Once the <application> has finished starting up, the <library> is available and the <revAppVersion> <function> can be used in any <handler>.
