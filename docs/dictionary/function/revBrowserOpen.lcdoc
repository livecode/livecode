Name: revBrowserOpen

Synonyms: xbrowser_open

Type: function

Syntax: revBrowserOpen(<windowId> [, <url> ] )

Syntax: XBrowser_Open <windowId> [, <url>]

Summary:
Opens and initialises a new browser

Introduced: 2.8.1

OS: mac, windows

Platforms: desktop

Security: network

Example:
local tBrowserId
put revBrowserOpen(the windowId \
      of this stack, "http://www.livecode.com" ) into tBrowserId
if tBrowserId is not an integer then
  answer "Failed to open browser"
end if

-- Using the old XBrowser syntax
XBrowser_Open the windowId of this stack, "http://www.livecode.com"
put the result into tBrowserId

Parameters:
windowId:
The operating system's ID for a stack window as given in the windowID
property. 

url:
Any url that can be accessed by the browser object in use.

Returns:
The <revBrowserOpen> function returns a value. If successful this will
be an integer browser instance id, if unsuccessful, the result will be
empty. 

The result:
If successful this will be an integer browser instance id, if
unsuccessful, the result will be empty. The browser library functions
will throw an execution error if they encounter a problem. These can be
caught by handling the <errorDialog> <message> or by using a <try / catch
block>. In general there is no need to check the <result>, as nearly all
the commands and functions put empty into it.

Description:
The <revBrowserOpen> function opens a new browser in the window with the
given <windowId>. If a <url> is given, the new browser immediately
navigates to this url.

>*Note:* The <url> must be a standards-compliant URL.  In particular,
> `file:` URLs must be of the form `file://<absolute path>`, and the
> path should be <URLEncode|URL-encoded>.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On Windows systems, the Internet Explorer
> browser is used by the <revBrowserOpen> function while on OS X Systems
> the Safari browser is used. To ensure cross-platform compatibility,
> don't use features that are not supported by both browsers, eg
> "ftp://" urls, which are only supported by Internet Explorer.

It is no longer necessary to initialise the Browser using XBrowser_Init,
and this command now does nothing, but is still included to prevent
legacy code causing script errors.

There is a sample stack for revBrowser at the following location in the
LiveCode folder: Resources/Examples/Browser Samper.rev. This stack
demonstrates, with many examples, how to use browser objects in an
application. 

General Notes on Using the Browser Library

The older XBrowser forms of all Browser library commands, functions and
messages have been retained for backwards compatiblity and these are
documented as synonyms. The XBrowser functions are deprecated, this
means that they should not normally be used in new code except for the
maintainance of older applications that depend on them.

The syntax of these older functions differs slightly from that
documented and used in the new functions.

The revBrowser functions (with the exception of <revBrowserOpen>) all
require a browser id, which tells LiveCode which browser object to act
upon. This id is returned by the revBrowserOpen function and should be
saved in the calling application. The browser id is always the first
parameter given to any revBrowser function and always the first
parameter passed to any browser callback.

The deprecated XBrowser functions can optionally take a browser id
parameter. If the browser id is not given, then the last browser created
by the XBrowser_Open command is used. The browser id is always the last
parameter passed to an XBrowser function.

Do not mix the revBrowser and XBrowser functions in an application. The
two sets of functions have not been designed to be compatible with each
other and mixing them will almost certainly cause unexpected results.

The default rect of a new browser instance is 0,0,0,0. To change this,
set the "rect" property using the <revBrowserSet> command.

The callbacks sent by the browser depend on whether the browser was
opened using revBrowserOpen or XBrowser_Open. If revBrowserOpen was
used, the callbacks prefixed with "browser" are used, otherwise, those
prefixed by "XBrowser_" are used.

It is currently possible to cancel browser operations by setting the
browserCancel global variable to true. If using the XBrowser functions,
then the global variable XBrowserCancel should be used instead.
