Description:
Use the <revDatabaseColumnNames> <function> to find out what <database field|database fields> are in the <record set (database cursor)|record set> returned by a <SQL query> or what database fields are contained within a certain table.

There are two forms of the revDatabaseColumnNames function. It can either be used to return the list of column names in a record set, or as of version 2.9, the list of columns in a given table. 

To get the list of columns in a record set use a form like this:

get revDatabaseColumnNames(tRecordSetId)

To get the list of columns in a given table, use a form like this:

get revDatabaseColumnNames(tConnectionId, "myTable")

If the operation is not successful, the <revDatabaseColumnNames> <function> returns an error message that begins with the <string> "revdberr".

>*Important:*  The <revDatabaseColumnNames> <function> is part of the <Database library>. To ensure that the <function> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section of the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure the "Database Support" checkbox is checked and the database drivers you are using are selected in the list of database drivers.

Changes:
The ability to obtain the list of fields for a table without obtaining a record set first was added in version 2.9
