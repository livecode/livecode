recordSetID:
The number returned by the revQueryDatabase function when the record set
was created.

Returns:
The <revDatabaseColumnTypes> <function> returns a list of data types,
one for each <column> in the <record set (database cursor)|record set>,
separated by commas.

Description:
Use the <revDatabaseColumnTypes> <function> to find out the data type of
a <database field>.

The possible data types are:

        * BIT
        * CHAR
        * STRING
        * WSTRING
        * BLOB (short for binary large object)
        * TIMESTAMP
        * DATE
        * TIME
        * DATETIME
        * FLOAT
        * DOUBLE
        * INTEGER
        * SMALLINT
        * WORD
        * BOOLEAN
        * LONG


You can use the <revDatabaseColumnTypes> <function> to find out what
kind of data you need to be prepared for. For example, if <BLOB> is one
of the data types, that <column> is <binary file|binary data>, so you
should not attempt to display it in a <field>.

>*Important:*  The <revDatabaseColumnTypes> <function> is part of the 
> <Database library>. To ensure that the <function> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this 
> <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your 
> <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions pane of the 
> <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure both the 
> "Database" library checkbox and those of the database drivers you are 
> using are checked.
