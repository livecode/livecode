Type: function

Syntax: revXMLChildContents(<treeID>, <startNode>, <tagDelim>, <nodeDelim>, <includePathDetails>, <depth>)

Summary: <return|Returns> a list of the <tag|tags> and text contents of the specified <nodes>.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
put revXMLChildContents(tTreeId, "root", tab, return, "full", -1) into tChildPaths

Parameters:
treeID: The number returned by the revXMLCreateTree or revXMLCreateTreeFromFile function when you created the XML tree.
startNode: The path to the node where you want to start.
tagDelim (string): A string that separates each tag name in a child node from the rest.
nodeDelim (string): A string that separates each child node from the rest.
includePathDetails: The includePathDetails can take the following values:   - "false" : just the name of each node is returned (default)   - "true" : includes which child number each node is in brackets after its name   - "full" : the full path of each node is returned including child numbers in brackets where required  - "relative" : a path relative to startNode is included with child numbers in brackets where required
depth: The depth specifies how many generations of the XML tree to show. If you specify zero, only the startNode is shown; if you specify 1, the startNode and its child nodes are shown, but not their child nodes; and so on. To show all generations, specify -1 as the depth.

Returns: The <revXMLChildContents> <function> returns a <string>.

Description:
Use the <revXMLChildContents> <function> to get information about a section of an <XML tree>.

If the <revXMLChildContents> <function> encounters an error, it <return|returns> an error message starting with "xmlerr".

The <revXMLChildContents> function returns the text content of a node. This is defined as the first piece of text not contained within a child node. For example:

&lt;root&gt;&lt;child&gt;Text&lt;subchild&gt;Child Text&lt;/subchild&gt;Text 2&lt;/child&gt;&lt;/root&gt;

In the preceeding XML document, <revXMLChildContents> will return the string "Text" when called with "root" as the <startNode> and 1 as the <depth>.

>*Important:*  The <revXMLChildContents> <function> is part of the <XML library>. To ensure that the <function> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "XML Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.
