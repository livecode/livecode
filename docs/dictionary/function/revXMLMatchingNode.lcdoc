Name: revXMLMatchingNode

Type: function

Syntax: revXMLMatchingNode(<treeID>, <startNode>, <childName>, <attributeName>, <attributeValue>, <depth> [, <caseSensitive>])

Summary: Finds the <node> in an <XML tree> where the specified attribute of the <node> has the specified value.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Security: disk

Example:
revXMLMatchingNode(1,revXMLRootNode(1),,"PubYear","2001",-1)

Example:
put revXMLMatchingNode(thisTree,it,field "Category",thisAttr,"Yes",4) after tFoundNodePaths

Parameters:
treeID: The number returned by the revXMLCreateTree or revXMLCreateTreeFromFile function when you created the XML tree.
startNode: The path to the node where you want to start.
childName (string): A string specifying which child nodes to scan. If it is empty, all child nodes are scanned. Otherwise, only child nodes whose name matches the childName are scanned.
attributeName: The name of the attribute you want to examine.
attributeValue: The value that the attributeName must have to be found.
depth: The depth specifies how many generations to scan. If you specify 1, the parentNode's child nodes are scanned, but not their child nodes. To scan all generations, specify -1 as the depth.
caseSensitive (bool): True or false and determines whether the attributeValue should be compared in a case-sensitive manner or not. If caseSensitive is not specified, then case is ignored when comparing attribute values (i.e. defaults to false).

Returns: The <revXMLMatchingNode> <function> returns a string consisting of the path to the first node containing the specified attribute with the specified value.

Description:
Use the <revXMLMatchingNode> function to search for a <node> by its <attribute|attributes>.

If the <revXMLMatchingNode> <function> encounters an error, it <return|returns> an error message starting with "xmlerr".

>*Important:*  The <revXMLMatchingNode> <function> is part of the <XML library>. To ensure that the <function> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "XML Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.
