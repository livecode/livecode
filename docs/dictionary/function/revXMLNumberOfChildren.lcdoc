Name: revXMLNumberOfChildren

Type: function

Syntax: revXMLNumberOfChildren(<treeID>, <startNode>, <childName> [, <depth>])

Summary: <return|Returns> the number of <child node|child nodes> under the specified <node> in an <XML tree>.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Security: disk

Example:
revXMLNumberOfChildren(3,myNode,,-1)

Example:
repeat for revXMLNumberOfChildren(theTree,theNode,"Book",1) times

Parameters:
treeID: The number returned by the revXMLCreateTree or revXMLCreateTreeFromFile function when you created the XML tree.
startNode: The path to the node whose child nodes you want to count.
childName (string): A string specifying which child nodes to count. If it is empty, all child nodes are counted. Otherwise, only child nodes whose name matches the childName are counted.
depth: The depth specifies how many generations to count. If you specify 0, only the parentNode's direct child nodes are counted, but not their child nodes. If you specify 1, the parentNode's child nodes are counted, along with their child nodes. To count all generations, specify -1 as the depth.

Returns: The <revXMLNumberOfChildren> <function> returns a <non-negative> <integer>.

Description:
Use the <revXMLNumberOfChildren> <function> to find out how many <child node|child nodes> a <parent node> has, or to find out how many of a particular kind of <child node|child nodes> it has.

If the <revXMLNumberOfChildren> <function> encounters an error, it <return|returns> an error message starting with "xmlerr".

>*Important:*  The revXMLAddElement <function> is part of the <XML library>. To ensure that the <function> works in a <standalone application>, you must include this <LiveCode custom library|custom library> when you create your <standalone application|standalone>. In the Inclusions section on the General screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window, make sure "XML Library" is selected in the list of script libraries.
