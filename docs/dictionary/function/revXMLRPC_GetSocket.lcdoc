Parameters:
XMLRPCdocumentID (integer):
The number returned by the <revXMLRPC_CreateRequest> when you created the
<XML-RPC> request, or the successful <revXMLRPC_Execute> <function> when you
executed an <XML-RPC> request.

Returns (string):
The <revXMLRPC_GetSocket> <function> returns the socket connection that
is established with the <host>. By default, <XML-RPC> uses the <post
command> to execute an <XML-RPC> request, but this has the overhead of
opening and closing a new socket every time. You can avoid this by
re-using an already opened <socket>.

Description:
Use the <revXMLRPC_GetSocket> <function> to retrieve the network socket
used in the execution of an <XML-RPC> request.

If the <revXMLRPC_GetSocket> <function> encounters an error, it
<return|returns> an error message starting with "xmlrpcerr" ..
