    <p>Use the <b>screenRect</b> <control_st tag="function">function</control_st> to find out the available screen sizes and to scale windows to the size of the screen.</p><p/><p><b>Value:</b></p><p>The <b>screenRect</b> <control_st tag="function">function</control_st> <glossary tag="return">returns</glossary> four <glossary tag="integer">integers</glossary>, separated by commas.</p><p/><p>The <b>screenRects</b> <control_st tag="function">function</control_st> <glossary tag="return">returns</glossary> a return-delimited list of four <glossary tag="integer">integers</glossary>, separated by commas.</p><p/><p><b>Comments:</b></p><p>In its singular form (<i>screenRect</i>) this function returns the virtual co-ordinates of the primary display.</p><p/><p>In its plural form (<i>screenRects</i>) this function returns a list containing the virtual co-ordinates of all the screens currently attached to the system. The first line is always that of the primary display, and the order of the rest are in an OS-specific order.</p><p/><p>The virtual co-ordinates of a screen a quadruple of four integers specifying the left, top, right and bottom of the rectangle. The right and bottom edges are not included in the screen's area.</p><p/><p>Adding the <i>working</i> adjective to either form returns the virtual co-ordinates of each screen's working-area. The working-area of a screen is defined to be the area not covered by OS furniture (such as the task bar on Windows, and the Dock and Menubar on Mac OS X).</p><p/>    <p>Adding the <i>effective</i> adjective to either form returns the area of the screen the application has to itself. In particular, if the keyboard is activated, it take into account if the keyboard is taking up space on the screen. (Android and iOS only)</p><p/><p><b>Note:</b> The co-ordinates returned by the screenRect family of functions can be anywhere in the virtual desktop defined by the OS - their values will depend on the user's local configuration. In particular, they can take both positive and negative values.</p>
