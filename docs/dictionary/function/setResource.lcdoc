Name: setResource

Type: function

Syntax: setResource(<destinationFile>, <resourceType>,[<resID>],[<resName>], <flagsList>, <data>)

Summary:
Places data in a specified resource in a <Mac OS> <file>.

Introduced: 1.1

OS: mac

Platforms: desktop

Security: disk

Example:
setResource("Include","BNDL",129,"document",RL,the bundleData of me)

Example:
setResource(it,"ICON",128,,,getResource(it,"ICON",130))

Parameters:
destinationFile:
The location and name of the file that contains the resource you want to
set. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes the file
is in the defaultFolder.

resourceType:
The 4-character type of the resources you want to change.

resID (integer):


resName (string):


flagsList:
A list that can contain one or more flag characters. The possible
resource flags are as follows: S System heap U Purgeable L Locked P
Protected R Preload C Compressed resourceThe flags may be listed in any
order. If a character is included, its corresponding resource flag is
set to true. If the character is not included in the flagsList, its
corresponding resource flag is set to false. If the flagsList is empty,
all the flags are set to false.

data:
Text or binary data, formatted appropriately for the resource type.

Returns:
The <setResource> <function> <return|returns> empty.

The result:
If the <destinationFile> is open, the <result> is set to
"Can't open resource fork". 

Description:
Use the <setResource> <function> to create a <resource> or change its
data. 

If the <destinationFile> does not exist, the <setResource> <function>
creates the <file>. If the <destinationFile> exists but has no <resource
fork>, the <setResource> function creates the <resource fork> and copies
the <resource> to it.

If the specified resource already exists, the <setResource> <function>
replaces the data in the <resource> with the <data>. Otherwise, the
<setResource> <function> creates the <resource>.

You must specify either a <resID> or <resName> or both. If you specify
one but not the other, the <setResource> <function> looks for an
existing <resource> with the specified name or ID, and replaces its
contents without changing the existing ID or name.

The <setResource> <function> is most useful when used with the
<getResource> <function>. Use the <getResource> <function> to obtain
resource data, process it as desired, then use the <setResource>
<function> to change the <resource>.

>*Warning:*  Resource data must be in the specific format appropriate to
> the resource type. If you set a <resource> to data that is
> incompatible with its resource type, you may damage the <resource> or
> the entire <resource fork> of the file. For information on the format
> of standard resource types, see Apple Computer's technical
> documentation, Inside Macintosh, located at
> http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macos8/mac8.html.
