Name: shell

Type: function

Syntax: the shell of <commandLine>

Syntax: shell(<commandLine>)

Summary:
Runs a <shell> command and returns its output.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
local tMyList
put shell("ls -l *.txt") into tMyList -- returns a listing of the current dir on Unix

Example:
get shell(field "Command") -- runs the shell command entered into the field labelled "Command"

Example:
get shell("attrib main.rev +R") -- sets the read-only (+R or +r) attribute of file "main.rev" on MSWindows

Example:
get shell("say" && "hello world") -- Will say the phrase on MacOS

Parameters:
commandLine (string):


Returns:
The value returned by the <shell> <function> is the result of the
<commandLine>, including any <error message|error messages> the
<commandLine> generates. (On <Unix|Unix systems>, the <stdout> and
<stderr> are combined to create the <return value>.) The current
<handler> pauses until the <shell> returns its result. If the command
was successful but did not return anything, the <shell> <function>
returns empty. The result is set to the shell command's exit code.

Description:
Use the <shell> <function> to <execute> a <command line>.

The <commandLine> must be a valid <shell> command on the current
operating system. Use the <shellCommand> <property> to set the <shell>
you want to use. The command is executed in the current <defaultFolder>.

>*Note:* If you use a <file path> in the <shell> command on a Windows
> system, the <file path> must be in Windows form, not the Unix-style
> <file path|file paths> that LiveCode uses internally.

To prevent a console window from appearing when the shell command is
executed, set the <hideConsoleWindows> property to true.

>*Tip:*  If you are having problems with the <shell> <function>, try
> <execute|executing> the <commandLine> at your operating system's
> <shell> prompt. (For example, on an <OS X|OS X system>, try executing
> the <commandLine> in the Terminal window.) If a <commandLine> does not
> work at the <shell> prompt, it won't work with the <shell> <function>
> either, so trying this can be useful when <debug|debugging>.

Changes:
Support for using the shell command on OS X systems was added in version
2.0.
