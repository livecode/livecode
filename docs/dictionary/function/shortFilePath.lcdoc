path>.

Parameters:
filePath:
The location and name of the file or folder whose short equivalent you
want. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode assumes the
file or folder is in the defaultFolder.

Returns:
The <shortFilePath> <function> <return|returns> a <file path>.

Description:
Use the <shortFilePath> <function> to obtain the equivalent of a file
path in short format for use in situations that require it.

The <shortFilePath> <function> transforms the <filePath> without looking
for the <file>, so it <return|returns> a value even if the <filePath>
does not exist.

On Mac OS, OS X, or Unix systems, the <shortFilePath> simply returns the
<filePath> without changing it.
