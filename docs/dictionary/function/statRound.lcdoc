Name: statRound

Type: function

Syntax: the statRound of <number>

Syntax: statRound(<number>, <precision>)

Summary:
Rounds off a number.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
the statRound of 2.5 -- yields 2, because 2 is even (rounds down)

Example:
the statRound of 3.5 -- yields 4, because 3 is odd (rounds up)

Example:
statRound(22.753, 2) -- yields 22.75

Example:
statRound(723.2, -1) -- yields 720

Parameters:
number:
Any number or expression that evaluates to a number.

precision (integer):
An integer giving the decimal place to round off to.

Returns:
The <statRound> <function> <return|returns> a number.

Description:
Use the <statRound> <function> to round off numbers and eliminate
insignificant digits for statistical applications.

The <statRound> <function> performs statistical rounding. If the
<number> is exactly halfway between two numbers, <statRound> rounds the
<number> to the nearest even <integer>. (To round off numbers such
numbers upward, as is the convention for financial applications, use the
<round> <function> instead.) Because of this, a set of numbers rounded
with <statRound> is not skewed upward, the way it is with the <round>
<function>. Therefore, you should use <statRound> when statistical
accuracy is required.

A positive <precision> indicates a place to the right of the <decimal
point>, and a <negative> <precision> indicates a place to the left. For
example, 1 rounds off to the nearest tenth, 2 rounds off to the nearest
hundredth, -1 rounds off by ten, and so on. If you don't specify a
<precision>, zero is used, meaning that the <number> is rounded off to a
whole number.

>*Note:* The <statRound> <function> is equivalent to
> <HyperCard|HyperTalk's> "round" <function>.
