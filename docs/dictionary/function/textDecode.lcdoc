Description:
Converts from binary data to text.

The <textDecode> function takes binary data, in the specified encoding, and returns the given string as text.

It is highly recommended that any time you interface with things outside LiveCode (files, network sockets, processes, etc) that you explicitly <textEncode> any text you send outside LiveCode and textDecode all text received into LiveCode. If this doesnt happen, a platform-dependent encoding will be used (which normally does not support Unicode text).

It is not, in general, possible to reliably auto-detect text encodings so please check the documentation for the programme you are communicating with to find out what it expects. If in doubt, try UTF-8.
