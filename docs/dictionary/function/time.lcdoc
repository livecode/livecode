Name: time

Type: function

Syntax: the [{ long | abbr[ev[iated]] | short }] [{ english | system }] time

Syntax: time()

Summary: <return|Returns> the current time.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
put the time into the lastModifiedTime of this card

Example:
set the label of button "Clock" to the short system time

Returns:
If the <useSystemDate> <property> is set to true or if you specify the <system> time, the times returned by the <time> <function> are <format|formatted> according to the user's system preferences.
If the <useSystemDate> is false or if you specify the <english> time, the times are in the <format> described below:

The time form returns the hour and minute separated by a colon, a space, and "AM" or "PM".

The short time form returns the same value as the time form.

The abbreviated time form returns the same value as the time form.

The long time form returns the hour, minute, and second separated by colons, a space, and "AM" or "PM".

Description:
Use the <time> <function> to display the current time to the user, or to store the time for later use.

If the twelveHourTime <property> is set to false, the value <return|returned> by the <time> <function> does not include "AM" or "PM".

The format of the system time forms is set by the Date & Time control panel (on Mac OS systems), the Date control panel (on <Windows|Windows systems>), or the LANG environment variable (on <Unix|Unix systems>).

>*Note:* Linux systems don't have a short system time, so the engine modifies the system time format string to remove the seconds. This works in most locales, but not all and our advice is to stick to using the long system time on Linux systems.

Changes:
The ability to use the time format preferred by the user was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the time function, along with the date function, consistently used the standard U.S. format, even if the operating system's settings specified another language or time format.
