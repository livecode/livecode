Name: topStack

Synonyms: topwindow, currentwindow

Type: function

Syntax: the topStack

Syntax: topStack()

Summary:
<return|Returns> the long <name> of the topmost <stack>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
the topStack

Example:
set the defaultStack to the topStack

Returns:
The <topStack> <return|returns> the long <name> of a <stack>.

Description:
Use the <topStack> <function> to find out which <stack> is in the
<current stack>.

In most applications, the active window holds the current document, and
menu commands operate on the active window. In LiveCode, because of the
ability to open stacks in various modes, this is not necessarily the
case. 

Each open window has a mode associated with it. The <topStack> is the
frontmost stack with the lowest <mode>.

For example, an editable window has a mode of 1, and a
<palette(command)> has a mode of 4. If several
<palette(glossary)|palettes> and <editable window|editable windows> are
open, the <topStack> is the frontmost editable <stack>, although
<palette(glossary)|palettes> may be in front of it. If all the <editable
window|editable windows> are then closed, the frontmost
<palette(command)> becomes the <topStack>, since there is now no window
with a lower <mode>.
