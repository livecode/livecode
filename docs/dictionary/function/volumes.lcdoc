Description:
Use the <volumes> <function> to find out which disks are available for

A volume is usually a disk, but a single disk may be partitioned into
multiple volumes, each of which appears as a separate icon. In this
case, each partitioned volume is listed separately by the <volumes>
<function>. 

Disks which are physically installed or inserted into a disk drive, but
are not currently mounted, do not appear in the list returned by the
<volumes> <function>.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, removable
> drives (such as floppy drives) that are connected, but do not contain
> a disk, do not appear in the list returned by the <volumes>
> <function>. On <Windows|Windows systems>, empty but connected
> removable drives are reported by the <volumes> <function>.

>*Note:* On Mac OS and OS X systems, volumes may contain slash
> characters (/) in their names. To use such a volume as part of a path,
> <replace> the slash with a semi colon before constructing the path.
