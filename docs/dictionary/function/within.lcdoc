Example:

Example:
within(field "News Items",the clickLoc)

Parameters:
object:
Any object reference.

point:
Any expression that evaluates to a point--a vertical and horizontal
distance from the top left of the current stack, separated by a comma.
(If the object is a stack, the distance is from the top left of the
screen.) 

Returns:
The <within> <function> <return|returns> true or false.

Description:
Use the <within> function to determine whether a <point> is inside the
specified <object(glossary)>.

If the <point> is within the clickable area of the <object(glossary)>,
the <within> <function> <return|returns> true, even if another
<object(glossary)> is layered on top of the <object(glossary)>.

If the <object(glossary)> is a <graphic(keyword)>, its interior is
considered to be within the <graphic(keyword)> only if the
<graphic(object)|graphic's> <filled> <property> is true or the
<graphic(keyword)> is <selected>.

If the <object(glossary)> is an <image(keyword)>, only <pixels> that
contain paint are considered to be within the <image(keyword)>.
Transparent parts of the <image(keyword)> are not within the
<image(keyword)>, although they are within the <image(object)|image's>
<rectangle>. 

If the <object(glossary)> is a <button(keyword)> whose <menuMode> is
"tabbed", only the tabs are considered to be within the button. The area
below the tabs is not within the <button(keyword)>, although it is
within the <button(object)|button's> <rectangle>.

If the <object(glossary)> is a <stack>, the <within> <function>
<return|returns> true if the <point> is in the <stack|stack's> content
area, and false if the <point> is in the <stack|stack's> <title bar> or
borders. 

The expression
<point> is within the rect of <object(glossary)> 
is equivalent to

    within(<object(glossary)>, <point>)

unless the <object(glossary)> <a/> is a graphic or image, or a tabbed
button.
