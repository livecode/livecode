Description:
Use the <URL> <keyword> to access the contents of a local <file> or a <file> accessible on the Web.

A <URL> is a method of designating a file or other resource. You can use a <URL> like any other container. You can get the contents of a <URL> or use its contents in any expression. LiveCode supports the following <URL> schemes:

http: a page from a web server
ftp: a directory or file on an FTP server
<file> : a text file on the local disk (not on a server)
binfile: a binary file
resfile: on Mac OS and OS X systems, the resource fork of a file

All actions that refer to a <URL> container are blocking: that is, the handler pauses until LiveCode is finished accessing the <URL>. Since fetching a web page may take some time due to network lag, accessing URLs may take long enough to be noticeable to the user. To avoid this delay, use the load command (which is non-blocking) to cache web pages before you need them.

For technical information about URLs and URL schemes, see [RFC 1630](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1630).

>*Important:*  The http and ftp keywords are part of the Internet library on desktop platforms. To ensure that these <URL> types work in a desktop standalone application, you must include this custom library when you create your standalone. In the Inclusions section of the Standalone Application Settings window, make sure Internet Library is selected in the list of script libraries. The iOS and Android engines do not support 'libUrl' but allow you to use <URL>. When specifying URLs for iOS and Android, you must use the appropriate form that confirms to RFC 1630. Ensure that you urlEncode any username and password fields appropriately for FTP urls.

>*Important:*  The space character is not valid in URLs, however libURL (Desktop platforms) replaces this character with the required '%20'. This is something that the mobile and server platforms do not do. Be careful to construct valid URLs when working an fully cross platform applications.

From LiveCode 7.0.0, URL keyword has been upgraded to understand Unicode files when using URL("file:"). If the file located at the path has a Byte Order Mark at its beginning, then URL will decode the file according to that Byte Order Mark (UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE are compatible). If no Byte Order Mark is found, then the file will be decoded as if it were using Native encoding (MacRoman on Mac OS X, ISO-8859-1 on Linux, CP-1252 on Windows).
