Description:
Use the <abbreviated> <keyword> to obtain a date, time, name, or ID with a moderate amount of detail.

In general, an <abbreviated> form is longer than the <short> form, but shorter than the <long> form.

If the useSystemDate <property> is set to false, an abbreviated <date> looks like this:
  Thu, Jan 27, 2000

If the useSystemDate is true, the abbreviated <date> is formatted according to the system settings.

If the useSystemDate <property> is set to false, an abbreviated <time> looks like this:
  11:22 AM

If the useSystemDate is true, the abbreviated <time> is formatted according to the system settings.
An abbreviated object <name> consists of the <object type>, followed by the name in quotes. For example, an abbreviated <card> name looks like this: card "This Card"

An abbreviated object <ID> looks like this: field ID 2238

>*Note:* The <abbreviated> <keyword> is implemented internally as a <property>, and appears in the <propertyNames>. However, it cannot be used as a <property> in an <expression>, nor with the <set command>.

Changes:
The form the abbreviated owner was introduced in version 2.0. In previous versions, the form of the owner property could not be specified and reported only the abbreviated owner.
