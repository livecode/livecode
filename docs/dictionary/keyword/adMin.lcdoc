set the ink of field ID 223 to adMin

Description:
Use the <adMin> <keyword> to darken the area under an <object>.

The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object> to determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed. When the <adMin> mode is used, each component of the <object> color--red, green, and blue--is compared with the corresponding component of the color underneath, and the minimum of each is used for the displayed color.

For example, suppose an object's color is 30,70,150, and the color of the pixels under the object is 60,40,100. If the <adMin> mode is used, the <object|object's> displayed color is 30,40,100.

The <adMin> mode can be used only on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>. On <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink> <property> is set to this mode appears as though their <ink> were set to <srcCopy>.
