Name: addPin

Type: keyword

Syntax: addPin

Summary: Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the ink of button "Bar" to addPin

The result: The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object> to determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed. When the <addPin> mode is used, each component of the <object> color--red, green, and blue--is added to the corresponding component of the color underneath. If the resulting number is greater than 127 (the maximum), 127 is used for that component.

Description:
Use the <addPin> <keyword> to combine an <object|object's> color with the colors underneath it.

For example, suppose an object's color is 240,0,100, and the color of the pixels under the object is 60,40,20. If the <addPin> mode is used, the <object|object's> displayed color is 127,40,120.

The <addPin> mode can be used only on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>.  On <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink> <property> is set to this mode appears as though their <ink> were set to <srcCopy>.
