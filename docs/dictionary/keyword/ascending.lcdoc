Name: ascending

Type: keyword

Syntax: ascending

Summary: Used with the <sort> <command> to specify that <sort|sorting> is in normal order (from less to greater).

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
sort this stack ascending by field "Order Number"

Description:
Use the <ascending> <keyword> to improve the clarity of your code. For example, if a <handler> contains several <sort(command)> <command|commands> and some are in descending order, you can use the <ascending> <keyword> explicitly to <point> up the fact that there are both ascending and descending <sort(glossary)|sorts>.

Since ascending is the default sort order, you never actually need to use the <ascending> <keyword>; if you leave it out, the <sort(command)> is performed in ascending order anyway.
