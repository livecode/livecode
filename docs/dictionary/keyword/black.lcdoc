Name: black

Type: keyword

Syntax: black

Summary: Used with the <visual effect> <command> to indicate that a blank black screen is shown at the end of the visual effect.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
visual effect push left to black

Description:
Use the <black> <keyword> to transition to a blank black <background> in a sequence of visual effects.

Visual effects can be stacked in a sequence by using several <visual effect> <command|commands> in succession. If the last transition ends with showing the <card>, and all except the last one shows an intermediate image (such as a solid black color), the effect is enhanced. You show a solid black color at the end of a transition by using the <black> <keyword>.

This example uses the push effect with the <black> <keyword> to emulate an old-fashioned slide projector:

  visual effect push left to black -- from card to solid black
  visual effect push right to card -- from black to final card
  go card "Destination"
