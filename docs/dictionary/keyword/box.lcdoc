Description:
Use the <box> <keyword> to emphasize text by drawing a box around it.

The box is drawn in the object's <borderColor> and <borderPattern>.

If the text crosses more than one screen line, a box is drawn around each line of the text.

If the text has mixed styles, a separate box is drawn around each style run. For example, if three words are boxed and the last is also boldface, a box is drawn around the first two words, and another box is drawn around the boldface word.

An object or chunk of a field may have the <box> or <threeDBox> style, but not both at once.
