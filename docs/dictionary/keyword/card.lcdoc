Name: card

Type: keyword

Syntax: card

Summary: Used with the <visual effect> <command> to show the destination <card(keyword)> at the end of the visual effect. Also used to refer to <card(object)|cards>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
visual effect push left to card

Example:
go to card 1

Description:
Use the <card> <keyword> to improve the clarity of your code. For example, if a <handler> contains several <visual effect> <command|commands>, you can use the <card> <keyword> explicitly to <point> up the fact that different destination images are being used.

Since by default, the image shown at the end of a visual effect is the destination card, you never actually need to use the <card> <keyword>; if you leave it out, the ending image is the <card> anyway.
