Description:
Use the <case> <keyword> to indicate the condition for which a set of
<statement|statements> should be <execute|executed>.

The <case> <keyword> can be used in two forms. The first form is used
when the <switch> <statement> includes an <expression> : the case is
<execute|executed> if the <value> after the <word> case is equal to the
expression in the <switch> <control structure>. For example, if the
<switch> <control structure|structure> starts with this <statement> :

    switch thisVariable


then a <case> <statement> inside the <switch> <control
structure|structure> might look like this:

    case 3


and the lines following the <case> <keyword> are executed if
thisVariable = 3. Use this form if you want to test a single value, and
do different things depending on what that <value> is equal to.

The second form is used when the <switch> <statement> does not include
an <expression> : the case is <execute|executed> if the <condition>
after the word case is true. For example, if the <switch> <control
structure|structure> starts with this <statement> :

    switch


then a <case> <statement> inside the <switch> <control
structure|structure> might look like this:

    case the short name of this card contains "a"


and the statements following the <case> <keyword> are <execute|executed>
if the <character> "a" appears in the <current card|current card's>
name.
