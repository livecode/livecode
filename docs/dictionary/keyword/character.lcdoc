Description:
Use the <character> keyword to refer to a specific character or characters in a container.

A character refers to what would naturally be thought of as a single graphical character, even if it is composed of multiple sub-units, as in some accented text or Korean ideographs. 

The hierarchy of the new and altered chunk types is as follows:

byte w of codeunit x of codepoint y of char z of word ...

>*Note:*  In versions prior to 7.0 the byte chunk was identical in functionality to the character chunk. In 7.0 and later a character is not an 8-bit unit and it is therefore not appropriate to use this type of chunk expression on binary data, to refer to 8-bit units in binary data use the <byte> keyword.
