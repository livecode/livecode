Description:
Anything between -- and the end of the current script line is treated as a comment and is ignored by LiveCode when executing the handler.

Comments are useful for documenting and explaining your code, either for others who might need to read and modify it, or for yourself. (The code may be clear in your mind now, but in six months, you'll be glad you included comments.)

Comments can be placed anywhere in a script--inside handlers or outside all handlers. In a long script with many handlers, it may be useful to divide the handlers into sections. Each section starts with a comment containing the section name and any other useful information. This practice helps you keep long scripts organized. Similarly, a lengthy handler can be made more readable by explanatory comments.

Comments can contain any text, including lines of LiveCode. If the code is within a comment, it's ignored. You can temporarily remove sections of code for debugging by putting those sections inside a comment.
