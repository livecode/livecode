Introduced: 1.0

Example:
sort cards dateTime by field "Last Modified Date"

Description:
Use the <dateTime> <keyword> when <sort|sorting> by a <field> or portion of a <container> that is a date or time.

Alphabetical sorting does not take the special format of dates and times into account. For example, a normal sort places 11:30 AM after 2:00 AM, because 2 is greater than 1. The <dateTime> <keyword> recognizes all <LiveCode|LiveCode's> date and time <format|formats> and <sort|sorts> them in time order, rather than alphabetical or numeric order.
