Name: default

Type: keyword

Syntax: default

Summary:
Used with the <decorations> <property> to specify the standard
appearance for a window type. When used within a <switch> <control
structure>, specifies a section of <statement|statements> to be
<execute|executed> in all cases.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the decorations of stack "Main" to default

Description:
Use the <default> <keyword> to set a <stack window> to a normal window
appearance. 

An editable window whose <decorations> <property> is set to default has
a title bar, <close box>, <zoom box>, and <collapse box> (on <Mac OS|Mac
OS systems>), or a <title bar>, <minimize button>, <maximize button>,
and <menu bar> (on <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>). A <palette>,
<modal>, or <modeless> window whose <decorations> is set to default has
a title bar.

If a <switch> <control structure> has a <default> section, the
<statement|statements> in the <default> section are <execute|executed>
if no break <statement> has been encountered yet in the <switch>
<control structure>. (Usually, there is a <break> <statement> within
each <case> section, so the <default> section is <execute|executed> only
if none of the <case> conditions is true.)
