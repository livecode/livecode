Name: for

Type: keyword

Syntax: for

Summary:
Used in a <repeat> <control structure> to specify the number of times
the <loop> should repeat.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
repeat for 10 times

Example:
repeat for (the number of buttons)

Description:
Use the <for> <keyword> to specify a fixed number of
<iteration|iterations> of a <loop>.

The number may be a literal number, or an expression that evaluates to a
number. (If the number is not an integer, it is rounded to the nearest
integer.) Either way, the number is evaluated when the <repeat> <control
structure> is entered, and is not re-<evaluate|evaluated> as a result of
<statement|statements> in the <loop>. For example, if the <repeat>
<control structure> begins with the line

    repeat for the number of cards


then this number is evaluated as of the start of the loop, and the
number does not change even if the statements in the loop create or
delete cards. For this reason, use caution when using the <for>
<keyword> with an <expression> : do not assume the <expression> will
have its current <value> when the <statement|statements> inside the
<loop> are <execute|executing>.
