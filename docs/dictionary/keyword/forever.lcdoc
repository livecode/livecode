Description:
Use the <forever> <keyword> to repeat until an <exit repeat> <statement>
within the <loop> explicitly ends the <loop> or until the heat death of
the universe, whichever comes first.

All forms of the <repeat> <control structure> that test for a condition,
test at the top of the <loop> (before each <iteration>). If you want to
test at the bottom of the <loop>, use the <forever> <keyword>, and use a
<conditional> <exit repeat> at the bottom of the <loop> :

    repeat forever
    -- statements here
    if myCondition is true then exit repeat

    end repeat
