Name: gRevProfileReadOnly

Type: keyword

Syntax: gRevProfileReadOnly

Summary:
A special <global|global variable> that specifies whether to save
changes to the current <property profile|profile> when you switch
<property profile|profiles>.

Associations: profile library

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
global gRevProfileReadOnly
if gRevProfileReadOnly is false then switchToLargeFonts

Description:
Set the <gRevProfileReadOnly> <variable> to false when configuring a
<property profile|profile>, so that changes you make to an
<object|object's> <properties> are saved in the current <property
profile|profile>. 

Each object can have one or more profiles, which include settings for
each property in the object's properties <property>. The
<gRevProfileReadOnly> <variable> controls what happens when you set an
<object|object's> <property profile|profile>, make changes to its
<properties>, then switch to a different <property profile|profile>.

If this global variable is false, the profile is re-saved when you
switch profiles, and any property changes you've made are saved in the
profile. If it's true, the profile isn't saved when you switch to
another profile.

The <gRevProfileReadOnly> <global|global variable> can also be changed
in the Preferences dialog box:

1. Choose LiveCode â†’ Preferences from the menubar.
2. Choose "Property Profiles" from the menu at the top.
3. Click "Don't save settings when switching profiles".
