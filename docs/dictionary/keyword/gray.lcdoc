visual effect dissolve to gray

Description:
Use the <gray> <keyword> to transition to a blank gray background in a sequence of visual effects.

Visual effects can be stacked in a sequence by using several <visual effect> <command|commands> in succession. If the last transition ends with showing the destination card, and all except the last one shows an intermediate image (such as a solid gray color), the effect is enhanced. You show a solid gray color at the end of a transition by using the <gray> <keyword>.

The gray background is actually a checkerboard pattern of alternating black and white pixels.

This example dissolves the image on the screen through an intermediate blank gray screen:

  visual effect dissolve to gray -- from card to solid gray
  visual effect dissolve to card -- from gray to final card
  go card "Destination"
