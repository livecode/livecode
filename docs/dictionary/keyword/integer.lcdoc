Name: integer

Type: keyword

Syntax: integer

Summary: Used with the <is a> and <is not a> <operator|operators> to check whether a value is an <integer>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
if field "Number to Order" is not an integer then beep

Description:
Use the <integer> <keyword> to find out whether a value is a number that doesn't have a fractional part.

If the value contains digits (and an optional minus sign) and no other characters, it is an integer.

If the value is an expression, it is evaluated and LiveCode checks whether the final value is an integer. For example, the value of the expression "22 - 3" is 19 (which is an integer), so the following expression evaluates to true:

  22 - 3 is an integer

However, the expression
  "22 - 3" is an integer
evaluates to false, because the double quotes prevent the expression "22 - 3" from being evaluated.
