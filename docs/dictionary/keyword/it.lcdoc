Description:
Use the <it> <keyword> to get the result of certain <command|commands>, or as a handy temporary storage place.

The <it> <keyword> designates a special <local variable>. <It> can be used like any other <local variable>: you can put a <value> into <it>, or put <it> into another <container>.

The commands that use the <it> <variable> are:  <answer>, <answer color>, <answer effect>, <answer file>, <answer folder>, <ask>, <ask file>, <ask password>, <clone>, <convert>, <copy>, <create>, <get>, <paste>, <post>, <read from driver>, <read from file>, <read from process>, <read from socket>, <request>, and <request appleEvent>.

Unlike other local variables, <it> can change even if you don't explicitly change its <value>. Certain <command|commands> use it to store their result. Therefore, if you need to use the <value> of <it>, make sure none of these <command|commands> is <execute|executed> between the time you set <it> and the time you read its <value>. If you need to save the <value> of <it> for later use, store it in another <variable> :

  put it into savedFilePath
