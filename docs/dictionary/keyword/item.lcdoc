Description:
Use the <item> <keyword> to refer to a specific <chunk> of data in a <container>.

By default, an item is delimited by commas (,). However, you can set the <itemDelimiter> <property> to any <character> in order to directly address <chunk|chunks> <delimit|delimited> by that character. For example, you can set the <itemDelimiter> to <tab> in order to handle a database file whose fields are tab-<delimit|delimited>.

An item is a string of characters delimited by a single comma (or a single one of the <itemDelimiter> <character>). A single <item> can contain multiple <characters>, multiple <words>, and multiple <lines>.

>*Note:* In LiveCode, if the last character of a string is the itemDelimiter, then this character is ignored by the <item> keyword. For example the last item of  the string "1,2,3," is "3" (assuming comma is the itemDelimiter)
