Name: line

Type: keyword

Syntax: line

Summary:
Designates a return-<delimit|delimited> <string> as part of a <chunk
expression>. It also designates the <paint tool> used to draw line
shapes and specifies, through the <style> <property>, that a <graphic>
is a line.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
get line 3 of the stacks

Example:
choose line tool

Example:
set the style of graphic "Divider" to "line"

Description:
Use the <line> <keyword> to paint a curved line with the <penColor>, to
draw a line shape, or to refer to a specific <line> or <lines> in a
<container>. 

When using the Line tool, the cursor is a crosshairs shape (over stack
windows) or an arrow (anywhere else). This tool is used to draw a
straight line in the penColor.

If you try to paint with the Line tool on a card that has no images, an
image the size of the card is created to hold the painting. If the
current card already has one or more images, painting outside the image
has no effect.

Setting the <style> of a <graphic(keyword)> to "line" makes the
<graphic(keyword)> into a curved line. Line <graphic(object)|graphics>,
unlike painted lines, can be changed and reshaped: use the <points>
<property> to change the line's angle and position.

>*Note:* To avoid script errors, enclose the word "line" in <double
> quote|double quotes> when you use it to indicate a
> <graphic(object)|graphic's> <style>. This prevents <LiveCode> from
> getting confused about whether you mean the line style, or the
> contents of a line in a <container>.

By default, a line is delimited by return (ASCII 10). However, you can
set the <lineDelimiter> <property> to any <character> in order to
directly address <chunk|chunks> <delimit|delimited> by that character.

A line is a string of characters delimited by a single return character
(or a single one of the <lineDelimiter> <character>). A single <line>
can contain multiple <characters>, multiple <words>, and multiple
<items>. 

>*Note:* In LiveCode, if the last character of a string is return, this
> is ignored by the <line> keyword. For example the last line of the
> following string is "Line 3" :

    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    &lt;empty Line&gt;


>*Note:* The <line> chunk is identical to the <paragraph> chunk, except
> that the <paragraph> chunk is also delimited by the Unicode paragraph
> separator character.
