Name: link

Type: keyword

Syntax: link

Summary: Used with the <textStyle> <property> to make a run of text in a <field> behave like a single <word> when clicked.

Synonyms: group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the textStyle of the foundChunk to link

Description:
Use the <link> <keyword> to create clickable text.

Text with its <textStyle> set to "link" is treated specially by the <clickText>, <clickChunk>, <mouseText>, and <mouseChunk> <function|functions>:  a style run of <grouped text> is treated as a single <word>. This makes <grouped text> handy to use for <hypertext> or "clickable text" features.

>*Note:*  Each continuous run of "link"-styled text is considered a single <grouped text|text group>, even if you <selected> part of the text and set its <textStyle> to "link", and set the <textStyle> of the other part later. It is not possible for two separate <grouped text|text groups> to exist if there are no <characters> between them.

To show which text in a field is grouped, it is underlined and displayed in the color specified by the <linkColor> <property>. Use the <hide groups> <command> to hide the underline.

Changes:
The link keyword was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the group synonym was used, and grouped text could be optionally displayed with a heavy gray underline.
