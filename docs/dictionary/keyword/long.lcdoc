Description:
Use the <long> <keyword> to obtain a <date>, <time>, <name>, <ID>, or list of
<files> or <folders> with the greatest amount of available detail.

In general, a <long> form is longer than either the <short> form or the
<abbreviated> form.

When used with a <files> or <folders> <function> it has the same effect
as using the term 'the detailed files' or 'the detailed folders'.

If the <useSystemDate> <property> is set to false, a long <date> looks
like this: Thursday, June 22, 2000
If the <useSystemDate> is true, the long <date> is formatted according to
the system settings.

If the <useSystemDate> <property> is set to false, a long <time> looks
like this: 11:22:47 AM
If the <useSystemDate> is true, the long <time> is formatted according to
the system settings.

A long object <name> consists of the <object type>, followed by the name
in quotes, for the <object(glossary)> and its <owner> (and the <owner>
of that <object(glossary)>, and so on). For example, a long <card> <name>
looks like this: card "My Card" of stack "/Drive/Folder/Stack.rev"

A long object <ID> looks like this:
card "My Card" of stack "/Drive/Folder/Stack.rev"

>*Note:*  The <long> <keyword> is implemented internally as a <property>
> and <function>, and appears in the <propertyNames> and the
> <functionNames>. However, it cannot be used as a <property> in an
> <expression>, nor with the <set> <command>.
