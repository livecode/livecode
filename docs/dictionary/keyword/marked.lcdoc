You use the <mark> <command> to set the <marked> <property> of a subset of <card(object)|cards>. Once marked, the <card(object)|cards> can be treated as a set by the <sort> or <print> <command>. The form sort marked cards sorts only the cards whose <mark> <property> is true. The form print marked cards prints only the cards whose <mark> <property> is true.

In card references, the <marked> <keyword> indicates a card selected from the subset of marked <card(object)|cards>. For example, the following <statement> goes to the first <card(keyword)> in the <current stack> whose <mark> <property> is true:

    go first marked card
