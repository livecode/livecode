Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Description:
Use the <normal> <keyword> to improve the clarity of your code, or to provide a cut to one of the supported visual effect colors.

Since normal is the default mode for the <find> <command>, you never need to actually use the <normal> <keyword>; if you leave it out, the search is performed in normal mode anyway.

When used with the <find> <command>, the <normal> <keyword> finds <card|cards> that contain each of the specified <word> beginnings, though not necessarily next to each other.
