Name: notSrcAndReverse

Type: keyword

Syntax: notSrcAndReverse

Summary:
Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used
with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the ink of card button 1 to notSrcAnd

Description:
Use the <notSrcAndReverse> <keyword> to invert the colors under an
object and make the light parts opaque.

The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine
with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object(glossary)> to
determine how the <object|object's> color (also called the source color)
is displayed.

The <notSrcAndReverse> <transfer mode> performs the following steps to
compute the color of each <pixel> :

1. Each component of the object's color--the number indicating the
   amount of red, green, or blue--is changed to its inverse. (If the
   color is expressed as three integers between zero and 255--one for
   each of red, green, and blue--then the inverse of each component is
   equal to 255 minus the component's value.)
2. Each component of the color underneath the object is changed to its
   inverse. 
3. LiveCode performs a bitAnd <operation> on each component of the
   inverted object color with the corresponding component of the
   inverted color under the <object(glossary)>.

Therefore the calculation made per pixel color is:
   (255 - object component) bitAnd (255 - background component)

The effect is that the color of the object is reversed, and the darker
an object is, the more transparent it is. Black parts of an object are
completely transparent, and white parts are completely opaque.

For example, suppose an object's color is 120,0,255, and the color of
the pixels under the object is 50,20,240. If the <notSrcAndReverse>
<transfer mode> is used, the <object|object's> displayed color is
135,235,0. In <binary(glossary)> it is:

   10000111, 11111111, 00000000
   11001101, 11101011, 00001111 Logic AND
   ========  ========  ========
   10000101, 11101011, 00000000

The <notSrcAndReverse> mode can be used only on <Unix> and
<Windows|Windows systems>. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, <object|objects>
whose <ink> <property> is set to this mode appear as though their <ink>
were set to <srcCopy>.

A list of all <transfer mode|transfer modes> can be found in the
<transfer mode> glossary page for easy reference.
