Name: notSrcXOr

Type: keyword

Syntax: notSrcXOr

Summary:
Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used
with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the ink of scrollbar "Progress" to notSrcXOr


Description:
Use the <notSrcXOr> <keyword> to invert the colors of an
<object(glossary)> and make the light parts transparent.

The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine
with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object(glossary)> to
determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed.

The <notSrcXOr> <transfer mode> performs the following steps to compute
the color of each <pixel> :

1. Each component of the object's color--the number indicating the
   amount of red, green, or blue--is changed to its inverse. (If the
   color is expressed as three integers between zero and 255--one for
   each of red, green, and blue--then the inverse of each component is
   equal to 255 minus the component's value.)
2. LiveCode performs a bitXOr <operation> on each component of the
   inverted object color with the corresponding component of the color
   under the <object(glossary)>.

Therefore the calculation made per pixel color is:
    (255 - object component) bitXOr background component


The effect is that the color of the object is reversed, and the darker
an object is, the more transparent it is.

For example, suppose an object's color is 120,0,255, and the color of
the pixels under the object is 50,20,240. If the <notSrcXOr> <transfer
mode> is used, the <object|object's> displayed color is 181,235,240.
In <binary(glossary)> it is:

    10000111, 11111111, 00000000
    00110010, 00010100, 11110000 Logic XOR
    ========  ========  ========
    10110101, 11101011, 11110000

The <notSrcXOr> mode can be used only on <Unix> and <Windows|Windows
systems>. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink>
<property> is set to this mode appear as though their <ink> were set to
<noOp>. 

A list of all <transfer mode|transfer modes> can be found in the
<transfer mode> glossary page for easy reference.
