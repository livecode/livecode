sort cards numeric by field "Social Security Number"

Description:
Use the <numeric> <keyword> when <sort|sorting> by a <field> or portion of a <container> that is a number.

Alphabetical sorting does not take into account the special format of numbers with more than one digit. For example, a normal sort places 72 after 1280, because the first digit of 72 is greater than the first digit of 1280 (7 is greater than 1). The <numeric> <keyword> <sort|sorts> numbers in <numeric> order, rather than alphabetical order.
