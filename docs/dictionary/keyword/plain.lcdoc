Use the <plain> <keyword> to create a visual effect that goes directly to the ending image, or to remove styles from an <object> or a <chunk> of text in a <field>.

Setting the <textStyle> of an <object> or <chunk> to <plain> removes all styles (such as bold or italic) that have previously been applied to the <object> or <chunk>.

The <plain> visual effect cuts directly to the final <image>, as though a visual effect had not been used at all.
