Name: point

Type: keyword

Syntax: point

Summary: Used with the <is a> and <is not a> <operator|operators> to specify whether a value is a <point>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
if it is not a point then exit mouseUp

Description:
Use the <point> <keyword> to find out whether a <value> can be used in <expression|expressions> that require a <point> on the screen.

If the value consists of two numbers separated by a comma or by whitespace, it is a point. The numbers may be non-integers.

If the value is an expression, it is evaluated and LiveCode checks whether the final value is a point. For example, the value of the expression "22 + 3,23" is 25,23 (which is a point), so the following expression evaluates to true:

  22 + 3,23 is a point

However, the expression
  "22 + 3,23" is a point
evaluates to false, because the double quotes prevent the expression "22 + 3,23" from being evaluated.
