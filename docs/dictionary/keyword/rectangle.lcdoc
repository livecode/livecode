Description:
Use the <rectangle> <keyword> to paint a rectangle or square with the <penColor> or to change a <graphic(keyword)> to a rectangle shape.

When using the Rectangle tool, the cursor is a crosshairs shape (over stack windows) or an arrow (anywhere else). This tool is used to draw a rectangle or square in the penColor, filled with the <brushColor> (or <brushPattern>).

If you try to paint with the Rectangle tool on a card that has no images, an image the size of the card is created to hold the painting. If the current card already has one or more images, painting outside the image has no effect.

Setting the style of a <graphic(keyword)> to rectangle makes the graphic into a rectangle. Rectangle <graphic(object)|graphics>, unlike painted rectangles, can be changed and reshaped: use the <height> and <width> <properties> to change the shape and size of the rectangle.

Setting the style of a <field> or <button> to rectangle <a/>makes it a rectangle shape.
