Description:
Use the <relative> <keyword> with the <read from file> and <write to
file> <command|commands> to move within a <file>, or with the <move>
<command> to move a <control> relative to its current location.

When used with the <seek> <command>, the <relative> <keyword> indicates
how far to move the current position. If the number is positive, the
<seek> <command> moves the current position by the specified number of
<characters> forward in the <file>. If the number is <negative>, the
current position is moved backward in the <file>.

(The current position in a file is set by the most recent read from
file, write to file, or <seek> <command>. If none of these
<command|commands> has been used on the <file> since it was opened, the
current position is zero. The next <read from file> or <write to file>
<command> starts from the new current position.)

When used with the <move> <command>, the <relative> <keyword> indicates
how many <pixels> to the right and down to move the <control>.
