Name: resfile

Type: keyword

Syntax: resfile

Summary:
Used as a URL type with such commands as <load> and <get> to designate
the resource fork of a Mac OS file.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
get URL "resfile:/Disk/System Folder/Apple Menu Items/Calculator App"

Example:
put tResForkData into URL "resfile:MyFile"


Description:
Use the <resfile> <keyword> to work with <Mac OS> <resource
fork|resource forks>.

On Mac OS systems, files consist of either or both of a <data fork> and
a <resource fork>. The resource fork contains defined resources such as
icons, menu definitions, dialog boxes, fonts, and so forth.

A <URL> container can be used anywhere another container type is used. The
LiveCode-specific scheme "resfile" indicates the resource fork of a file
which is located on the user's system. The file is specified by either
an absolute path starting with "/", or a relative path from the
defaultFolder. 

A <resfile> <URL> specifies the entire <resource fork>, not just one
<resource>. The most common use for this <URL> <URL scheme|scheme> is to
copy an entire <resource fork> from one <file> to another. To modify the
data from a <resfile> <URL>, you need to understand the details of
Apple's <resource fork> format and its relationship with the <data fork>.

    put empty into URL "file:myFile" -- creates an empty file

    put myStoredResources into URL "resfile:myFile"
    
>*Important:*  Unlike the <file> and <binfile> <URL> types, the
> <resfile> <keyword> cannot be used to create a <file>. If the <file>
> "myFile" doesn't yet exist, attempting to use it with the <resfile>
> <keyword> will fail and the <result> <function> will be set to
> "file not found". To create a new resource file, first use a <file>
> <URL> to create the <file> with an empty <data fork>, then write the
> needed data to its <resource fork>.
