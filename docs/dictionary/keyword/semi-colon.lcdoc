Name: ;

Type: keyword

Syntax: ;

Summary:
The <character> <;> is used to place more than one <statement> on a
single <line>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
go next card; wait 1 second; go previous card

Example:
local x
repeat with x = 1 to 10; put x after field 1; end repeat

Description:
Use the ; character to compress code into fewer visible <line|lines> for
easier reading.

Lines that are split with <;> are shown in the <script editor> as a
single <line>, but when <execute|executed>, are treated as multiple
<line|lines> of code. The following line counts as three
<statement|statements>: 

    go card 1; beep 2; answer the date


A <;> character which is used within a <literal string> does not signal
a new <line>, because the <;> is treated as part of the <string> instead
of being treated as a line break.
