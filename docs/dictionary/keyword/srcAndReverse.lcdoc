Name: srcAndReverse

Type: keyword

Syntax: srcAndReverse

Summary:
Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used
with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the ink of field "Check" to srcAndReverse


Description:
Use the <srcAndReverse> <keyword> to invert the color underneath the
light-colored parts of an object.

The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine
with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object(glossary)> to
determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed.

The <srcAndReverse> <transfer mode> performs the following steps to
compute the color of each <pixel> :

1. Each component of the color underneath the object--the number
   indicating the amount of red, green, or blue--is changed to its
   inverse. (If the color is expressed as three integers between zero
   and 255--one for each of red, green, and blue--then the inverse of
   each component is equal to 255 minus the component's value.)
2. LiveCode performs a bitAnd <operation> on each component of the
   inverted object color with the corresponding component of the color
   under the <object(glossary)>.

Therefore the calculation made per pixel color is:
    object component bitAnd (255 - background component)

The effect is that the lighter an object is, the more transparent it is
to the inverted color beneath. White parts of an object completely
invert the color underneath them, and black parts are completely opaque.

For example, suppose an object's color is 45,0,255, and the color of the
pixels under the object is 20,45,100. The inverse of the color
underneath is obtained by subtracting each component from 255, yielding
235,210,155. If the <srcAndReverse> <transfer mode> is used, the
<object|object's> displayed color is 41,0,155 (the decimal equivalent).
In <binary(glossary)> it is:

    00101101, 00000000, 11111111
    11101011, 11010010, 10011011 Logic AND
    ========  ========  ========
    00101001, 00000000, 10011011

The <srcAndReverse> mode can be used only on <Unix> and <Windows|Windows
systems>. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink>
<property> is set to this mode appear as though their <ink> were set to
<srcCopy>. 

A list of all <transfer mode|transfer modes> can be found in the
<transfer mode> glossary page for easy reference.
