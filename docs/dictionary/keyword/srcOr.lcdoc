Name: srcOr

Type: keyword

Syntax: srcOr

Summary: Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the ink of control 11 to srcOr

The result: Each component of the resulting color is equal to the result of this expression:.

Description:
Use the <srcOr> <keyword> to make the dark-colored parts of an object transparent.

The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object> to determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed.

When the <srcOr> <transfer mode> is used, LiveCode performs a <bitOr> operation on each component of the <object> color with the corresponding component of the color under the <object>.

object component bitOr background component

The effect is that the darker an object is, the more transparent it is. Black parts of an object are completely transparent, and white parts are completely opaque.

For example, suppose an object's color is 45,0,255, and the color of the pixels under the object is 20,45,100. If the <srcOr> <transfer mode> is used, the <object|object's> displayed color is 61,0,255 (the decimal equivalent).

The <srcOr> mode can be used only on <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>. On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink> <property> is set to this mode appear as though their <ink> were set to <srcCopy>.
