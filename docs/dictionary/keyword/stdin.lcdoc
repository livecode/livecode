Name: stdin

Type: keyword

Syntax: stdin

Summary: Used with the <read from file> <command> to designate the <standard input>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:

Description:
Use the <stdin> <keyword> to read data from the standard input, usually the keyboard.

On Unix systems, input to a program is normally read from the keyboard, but can be redirected to come from another device, process or file. This redirection is done on the command line when the program is started up.

On a server in CGI mode, stdin is assumed to contain post data, and reading from it prevents the engine's automatic processing of such information. 

When you use the <read from file> <command> with the <stdin> <keyword>, LiveCode reads data from the <standard input>.

Support for using <stdin> on Server was added in version 4.6.3.

Changes:
Support for using <stdin> on <OS X|OS X systems> was added in version 2.0.
