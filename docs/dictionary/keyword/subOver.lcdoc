Name: subOver

Type: keyword

Syntax: subOver

Summary:
Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used
with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the ink of last card button to subOver

The result:
The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine
with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object(glossary)> to
determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed. When the addOver
mode is used, each component of the color underneath the
<object(glossary)> is subtracted from the corresponding component--red,
green, and blue--of the <object(glossary)> color. If the result is less
than zero, the component rolls over backward, back to 255.

Description:
Use the <subOver> <keyword> to combine an <object|object's> color with
the colors underneath it.

For example, suppose an object's color is 25,250,150, and the color of
the pixels under the object is 60,40,100. If the <subOver> mode is used,
the <object|object's> displayed color is 220,210,50.

The <subOver> mode can be used only on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>. On
<Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink>
<property> is set to this mode appears as though their <ink> were set to
<srcCopy>.
