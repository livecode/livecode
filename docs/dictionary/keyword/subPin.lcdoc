Name: subPin

Type: keyword

Syntax: subPin

Summary:
Specifies one of the <transfer mode|transfer modes> that can be used
with the <ink> <property>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the ink of field 3 to subPin

Description:
Use the <subPin> <keyword> to combine an object's color with the colors
underneath it.

The <ink> <property> determines how an <object|object's> colors combine
with the colors of the <pixels> underneath the <object(glossary)> to
determine how the <object|object's> color is displayed. When the
<subPin> mode is used, each component of the <object(glossary)>
color - red, green, and blue - is subtracted from the corresponding
component of the color underneath. If the resulting number is less than
127 (the minimum), 127 is used for that component.

For example, suppose an object's color is 240,0,100, and the color of
the pixels under the object is 60,40,20. If the <subPin> mode is used,
the <object|object's> displayed color is 180,127,127. This is because
240 - 60 is greater than 127 and so red is displayed as 180, however,
both the green and blue components result is less than 127 so they
are *pinned* to the value of 127.

The <subPin> mode can be used only on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>.  On
<Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>, <object|objects> whose <ink>
<property> is set to this mode appears as though their <ink> were set to
<srcCopy>. 

A list of all <transfer mode|transfer modes> can be found in the
<transfer mode> glossary page for easy reference.
