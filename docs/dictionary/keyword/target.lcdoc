Use the <target> <keyword> to access the contents of the <field> named in the <target> <function>.

The only semantic difference between the <target> <function> and the <target> <keyword> is that the <target> <keyword> is not preceded by the word "the".

If the target object is not a field, the <target> <keyword> reports the name of the <object>, just like the <target> <function>.
