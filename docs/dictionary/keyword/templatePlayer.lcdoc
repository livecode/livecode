Description:
Use the <templatePlayer> <keyword> to set up <default> <properties> to be used for any new <player(object)|players> you create.

The <templatePlayer> can be thought of as a special, abstract <object>. It is not an actual <player(keyword)>, but it has all the <properties> of a <player(keyword)>. The <ID> <property> of the <templatePlayer> is zero.

You can use the <set> <command> to set the <properties> of the <templatePlayer> before creating a <player(keyword)>. The new <player(keyword)> has the <properties> of the <templatePlayer>, by <default>. Changing the <properties> of the <templatePlayer> does not affect existing <player(object)|players>.

The properties of the <templatePlayer> can be returned to the default settings using the <reset> command.

You can refer to the <templatePlayer> using any of the following forms:
        templatePlayer
        the templatePlayer
        templatePlayer()

>*Note:* The <templatePlayer> <keyword> is implemented internally as a <function> and appears in the <functionNames>. However, it cannot be used as a <function> in an <expression>.
