You can use the <set> <command> to set the <properties> of the <templateStack> before creating a <stack>. The new <stack> has the <properties> of the <templateStack>, by <default>. Changing the <properties> of the <templateStack> does not affect existing <stacks>.

The properties of the <templateStack> can be returned to the default settings using the <reset> command.

You can refer to the <templateStack> using any of the following forms:
        templateStack
        the templateStack
        templateStack()

>*Note:* The <templateStack> <keyword> is implemented internally as a <function> and appears in the <functionNames>. However, it cannot be used as a <function> in an <expression>.
