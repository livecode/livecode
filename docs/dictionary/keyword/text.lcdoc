Name: text

Type: keyword

Syntax: text

Summary: Used with the <sort> and <sort container> <command|commands> to sort normally, <character> by <character>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
sort cards descending text by field "State"

Example:

Description:
Use the <text> <keyword> to improve the clarity of your code. For example, if a <handler> contains several <sort(command)> <command|commands> and some are <numeric>, you can use the <text> <keyword> explicitly to point up the fact that there are both alphabetic and numeric <sort(glossary)|sorts>.

Since text is the default sort order, you never actually need to use the <text> <keyword>; if you leave it out, the <sort(command)> is performed alphabetically anyway.
