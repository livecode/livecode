Description:
Use the <the> <keyword> to unambiguously indicate how an <expression>
should be parsed.

The <the> <keyword> is mandatory before the names of built-in
<function(glossary)|functions>, unless the parentheses form of the
<function(control structure)> is used:

    get the time -- must use "the" if () are not used
    get time()   -- cannot use "the" if () are used


The <the> <keyword> is optional before the names of <properties>, but it
is good style to include it.

function (glossary), expression (glossary), this (keyword), of (keyword),
properties (property)
