Name: while

Type: keyword

Syntax: while

Summary:
Used with the <repeat> <control structure> to specify that the <loop> is
to repeat as long as the specified condition remains true.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
repeat while the mouse is down

Example:
repeat while myVariable is empty

Description:
Use the <while> <keyword> to repeat a sequence of instructions as long
as a condition continues to be true.

LiveCode evaluates the condition each time the loop repeats, at the top
of the loop (before the statements in the <repeat structure> are
executed). If the condition is false, the <loop> is skipped and
<execute|execution> <resume|resumes> with the <statement> after the <end
repeat> statement.

If the condition is already false when LiveCode reaches the <repeat
statement>, the <loop> is not <execute|executed> at all.
