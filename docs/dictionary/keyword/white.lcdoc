visual effect iris open to white

Description:
Use the <white> <keyword> to transition to a blank white background in a sequence of visual effects.

Visual effects can be stacked in a sequence by using several <visual effect commands(command)> in succession. If the last transition ends with showing the card image, and all except the last one shows an intermediate image (such as a solid white color), the effect is enhanced. You show a solid white color at the end of a transition by using the <white> <keyword>.

This example uses a camera iris effect to transition through an intermediate blank white screen to the final image:

  visual effect iris close to white -- from card to solid white
  visual effect iris open to card   -- from white to final card
  go card "Destination"
