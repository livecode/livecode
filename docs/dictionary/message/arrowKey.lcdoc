Name: arrowKey

Type: message

Syntax: arrowKey {up | down | left | right}

Summary:
the <active (focused) control(glossary)>, or to the <current card> if no
<control> is <focus|focused>, when the user presses an arrow key.

Associations: button

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
on arrowKey theKey -- make Up arrow go to the first card
  if theKey is "up" then go to card 1
  else pass arrowKey
end arrowKey

Description:
The parameter indicates which arrow key was pressed.

Handle the <arrowKey> <message> if you want to do something special when
the user presses an arrow key.

If the <arrowKey> <handler> does not <pass> the <message> or <send> it
to a further <object(glossary)> in the <message path>, LiveCode does not
perform the usual arrow key action (moving the <insertion point>, moving
the <selected> <object(glossary)>, or navigating to another card).
<pass|Passing> the <message> lets the arrow key action take place.

If the focused control is part of a group, and the group's
tabGroupBehavior <property> is set to true, no <arrowKey> <message> is
sent when the user presses an arrow key.

>*Note:* Sending an <arrowKey> message does nothing unless there is an
> <arrowKey> <handler> in the <message path>. This is a difference from
> <HyperCard|HyperTalk's> handling of the <arrowKey> <message>.
