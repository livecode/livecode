Description:
Handle the <browserLoadRequest> message to perform an action when a URL has been requested.

The <browserLoadRequest> message is sent to the object containing the script that created the UIWebView browser control after a url has been requested.

Not passing the message causes the load request to not go ahead.

The browserLoadRequest is only sent if <delayRequests(command)> has been set to true. 

>*Note:* Delaying requests can cause web pages that load pages into sub-documents to not work correctly.

>*Note:* The <browserLoadRequest> message is sent in response to the webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest: delegate method.
