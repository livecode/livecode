Description:
Handle the <closeBackground> <message> if you want to perform cleanup or
do other tasks when the user leaves a <background>.

A background is closed when the user either goes to a card that doesn't
have the group on it, or closes the stack.

The <closeBackground> <message> is sent only if the
<group(glossary)|group's> <backgroundBehavior> <property> is set to
true. If the <group(glossary)|group's> <backgroundBehavior> is false, no
<closeBackground> <message> is sent, even if the <group(command)> is
placed on multiple <card|cards>.

A separate <closeBackground> <message> is sent for each <background>
that is being closed.
