A background is closed when the user either goes to a card that doesn't have the group on it, or closes the stack.

The <closeBackground> <message> is sent only if the <group(glossary)|group's> <backgroundBehavior> <property> is set to true. If the <group(glossary)|group's> <backgroundBehavior> is false, no <closeBackground> <message> is sent, even if the <group(command)> is placed on multiple <card|cards>.

A separate <closeBackground> <message> is sent for each <background> that is being closed.
