Example:

  if the text of me is not a date then
    beep

Description:
Handle the <closeField> <message> if you want to make sure a <field(object)|field's> content is correct after it has been changed.

The selection is removed from a field (and the field loses focus) when another window is brought to the front, when the user clicks in another field, or when the user tabs out of the field. The field also loses focus when the select <command> is used to <select> text in another <field>. However, the <closeField> <message> is not sent when the user clicks in the same <field>.

The <closeField> <message> is not sent when a <handler> changes the field's contents using the <put> <command>.

If the lookAndFeel <property> is set to "Macintosh", the <closeField> <message> is generally not sent when another control (such as a <button(keyword)>) is clicked. This is because clicked buttons do not receive the <focus> on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, and therefore the <selection> remains active.

The <closeField> <message> is also sent to <button(object)|buttons> whose <menuMode> is "comboBox", since the type-in box in a <combo box> behaves like a <field>.

If a field is closing and its contents have not changed, the <exitField> <message> is sent instead of <closeField>.
