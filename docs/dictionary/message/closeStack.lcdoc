Description:
Handle the <closeStack> <message> if you want to perform cleanup or do other tasks when the user closes a window.

A stack is closed when the user or a handler closes the stack window.

The actual closing is not triggered by the <closeStack> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the <stack> from closing. To prevent a <stack> from closing, <trap> the <closeStackRequest> <message>.
