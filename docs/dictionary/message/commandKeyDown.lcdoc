Name: commandKeyDown

Type: message

Syntax: commandKeyDown <keyName> 

Summary: Sent when a Command <key combination> (Control-key on <Unix> or <Windows>) is pressed.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
on commandKeyDown theKey -- make Command-5 go back
  if theKey is "5" then go recent card else pass commandKeyDown
end commandKeyDown

Parameters:
keyName: The actual character of the pressed key.

Description:
Handle the <commandKeyDown> message if you want to provide Command-key or Control-key shortcuts (other than those provided in <menus> and <button(object)> accelerators).

The <commandKeyDown> <message> is sent to the <active (focused) control(glossary)>, or to the <current card> if no <control> is <focus|focused>.

If the Command key is pressed along with the Return, Tab, Backspace, Delete, or Enter key, with an arrow key, or with a function key, no <commandKeyDown> <message> is sent. Instead, the <returnKey>, <tabKey>, <backspaceKey>, <deleteKey>, <enterKey>, <arrowKey> or <functionKey> <message> is sent. To trap a combination such as Command-Return or Control-Return, use a <returnKey> <handler> and check the <commandKey> <function> inside the <handler>.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, the <commandKeyDown> <message> is sent when the user presses a key while holding down the <Command key>. On <Unix> or <Windows|Windows systems>, the <commandKeyDown> <message> is sent when the user presses the Control key, whether or not another key is pressed at the same time.
