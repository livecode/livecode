Name: currentTimeChanged

Type: message

Syntax: currentTimeChanged <newTime>

Summary:
Sent to a <player> when the user switches to another <frame>.

Associations: player

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
on currentTimeChanged theInterval -- display the time in a field
  put theInterval into field "Time Code"
end currentTimeChanged

Parameters:
newTime:
The number of the interval where the player is after the change.

Description:
Handle the <currentTimeChanged> message if you want to do something when
the user changes the current time in a <player>.

The user can change the current time by clicking in the controller bar
or by using the arrow keys when the player is the active (focused)
control. 

The number of intervals per second is specified by the player's
timeScale <property>. The total number of intervals is given in the
<player(object)|player's> <duration> <property>.

The actual process of changing the player's current time is not
triggered by the <currentTimeChanged> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the
<message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the user from
changing the <player(object)|player's> current time manually.

Changes:
The newTime parameter was introduced in version 2.0. In previous
versions, the currentTimeChanged message did not have a parameter.
