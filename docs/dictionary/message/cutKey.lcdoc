Description:
Handle the <cutKey> <message> if you want to change the normal cut
process, or prevent use of the Cut <keyboard equivalent> without
changing the menu.

The LiveCode development environment traps the <cutKey> <message>. This
means that the <cutKey> <message> is not received by a <stack> if it's
running in the <development environment>, To test a <cutKey> <handler>,
choose Development â†’ Suspend Development Tools from the menubar.

<cutKey> <message> is sent when the user presses Command-X (on 
<Mac OS|Mac OS systems>), Control-X (on <Windows|Windows systems>),
Shift-Delete (on <Unix|Unix systems>), or the keyboard Cut key.

The message is sent to the active (focused) control, or to the current
card if no control is focused.
