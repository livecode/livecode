Name: deleteAudioclip

Type: message

Syntax: deleteAudioclip

Summary:
Sent to a <audioclip(object)> just before it is removed from the
<stack>. 

Associations: audioclip

Introduced: 8.1

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Description:
Handle the <deleteAudioclip> message if you want to perform cleanup
before a <audioclip(object)> is removed from the <stack>.

The actual deletion is not triggered by the <deleteAudioclip> <message>,
so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does
not prevent the <audioclip(object)> from being removed.

However, the undo <command> will restore a <audioclip(object)> after
it is deleted by the user.
