Name: deleteButton

Type: message

Syntax: deleteButton

Summary: Sent to a <button(object)> just before it is removed from the <stack>.

Associations: button

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
on deleteButton -- prevent the deletion by immediately undoing it

end deleteButton

Description:
Handle the <deleteButton> message if you want to perform cleanup before a <button(object)> is removed from the <stack>.

The actual deletion is not triggered by the <deleteButton> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the <button(object)> from being removed.

However, the undo <command> will restore a <button(object)> after it is deleted by the user.
