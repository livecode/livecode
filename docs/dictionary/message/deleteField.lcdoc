Name: deleteField

Type: message

Syntax: deleteField

Summary:
Sent to a <field> just before it is removed from the <stack>.

Associations: field

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
on deleteField -- first save the contents in a custom property
   set the uFieldText[the short name of the target] of this card to \
         the text of the target
   pass deleteField
end deleteField

Description:
Handle the <deleteField> <message> if you want to perform cleanup before
a <field> is removed from the <stack>.

The actual deletion is not triggered by the <deleteField> <message>, so
<trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not
prevent the <field> from being removed.

However, the undo <command> will restore a <field> after it is deleted
by the user. For example, the following <handler>, placed in a <card> or
stack <script>, effectively prevents a <field> from being deleted by the
user: 

    on deleteField
    beep
    send "undo" to this card in 5 milliseconds

    end deleteField
