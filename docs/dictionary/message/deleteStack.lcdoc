Description:
Handle the <deleteStack> <message> if you want to perform cleanup before a <stack> is deleted from its <stack file>.

The actual deletion is not triggered by the <deleteStack> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the <stack> from being removed.

If a stack's file is deleted with the delete file <command> (or by the user), and the stack itself is not open, no <deleteStack> <message> is sent.
