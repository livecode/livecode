Name: dragEnter

Type: message

Syntax: dragEnter

Summary:
Sent when the <mouse pointer> moves into an <object(glossary)> during a
<drag and drop>.

Introduced: 2.0

Associations: card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player, image

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
on dragEnter -- show a green outline around the drop target
  set the borderColor of the target to "green"
end dragEnter

Description:
Handle the <dragEnter> <message> to perform an action (for example,
display a special cursor or set the <acceptDrop> <property>) when the
<mouse pointer> enters an <object(glossary)>.

The <dragEnter> <message> is sent only when a <drag and drop> operation
is in progress.

If two controls overlap, a <dragEnter> <message> is sent whenever the
<mouse pointer> crosses into a visible portion of a <control>. The
<control> on the bottom receives a <dragEnter> <message> only when the
<mouse pointer> enters part of the <control> that can be seen. A
<control> that is completely hidden by another <control> on top of it
will never receive a <dragEnter> <message>.

>*Tip:*  Use the <mouseLoc> function to determine where the 
> <mouse pointer> is. Use the <target> <function> to determine which 
> <control> the <mouse pointer> has entered.
