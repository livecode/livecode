Description:
Handle the <enterInField> <message> when you want to perform an action  when the user presses Enter in a <field>.

The Enter key is usually located on the numeric keypad. It is a different key from the Return key (confusingly labeled "Enter" on some keyboards), which is usually located above the right-hand Shift key.

If the <enterInField> <handler> does not <pass> the <message> or send it to a further <object> in the <message path>, the keypress has no effect. <pass|Passing> the <message> allows the keypress to have its normal effect.

If there is no selection or insertion point in any field and the user presses Enter, the <enterKey> <message> is sent instead of <enterInField>.
