    <p>Handle the <b>exitField</b> message if you want to do something when the user leaves a field that hasn't been changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p>The selection is removed from a field (and the field loses focus) when another window is brought to the front, when the user clicks in another field, or when the user tabs out of the field. The field also loses focus when the <command tag="select">select command</command> is used to select text in another field. However, the <b>exitField</b> message is not sent when the user clicks another point in the same field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>exitField</b> message is sent to buttons whose <property tag="menuMode">menuMode</property> is "comboBox", since the type-in box in a combo box behaves like a field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>exitField</b> message is sent only if the field's contents have not changed since the last time it received the <message tag="openField">openField message</message>. If a field is closing and its contents have changed, the <message tag="closeField">closeField message</message> is sent instead of <b>exitField</b>. This means that if you want to take an action when the selection is removed from a field--whether the field has changed or not--you must handle both <message tag="closeField">closeField</message> and <b>exitField</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the field's contents were changed by script using the <command tag="put">put command</command>, then <b>exitField </b>will still be sent. <message tag="closeField">closeField</message> is only sent when the contents are changed by the user.</p>
