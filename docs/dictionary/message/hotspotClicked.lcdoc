Description:
Handle the <hotspotClicked> <message> if you want to perform some
additional action when the user clicks a hot spot in a <QuickTime VR>
movie. 

Each hot spot of a QuickTime VR movie is a clickable link, usually from
one node to another. The movie author sets the hot spots during
development of the movie. The user clicks a hot spot in the player to
activate the link.

If the user navigates to another node by clicking a hot spot in the
QuickTime VR movie, a <nodeChanged> <message> is sent after the
<hotspotClicked> <message>.

Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
