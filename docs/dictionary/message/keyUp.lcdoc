card if no control is focused.

If the key pressed is the Return, Tab, Backspace, Delete, or Enter key,
an arrow key, or a function key, no <keyUp> <message> is sent.

> <execute|executing>, whether or not the key has been released. On
> <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>, the <keyUp> <message> is sent
> when the key is released, after the typed character has been added to
> the current <field>. To test whether a key is actually being pressed,
> use the <keysDown> <function>.
