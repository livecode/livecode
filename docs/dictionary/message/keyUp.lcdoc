Description:
Handle the <keyUp> <message> if you want to do something special when the user releases any key (or a particular key you check for in the <handler>).

The message is sent to the active (focused) control, or to the current card if no control is focused.

If the key pressed is the Return, Tab, Backspace, Delete, or Enter key, an arrow key, or a function key, no <keyUp> <message> is sent.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, the <keyUp> <message> is sent after any <keyDown> <handler|handlers> finish <execute|executing>, whether or not the key has been released. On <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems>, the <keyUp> <message> is sent when the key is released, after the typed character has been added to the current <field>. To test whether a key is actually being pressed, use the <keysDown> <function>.
