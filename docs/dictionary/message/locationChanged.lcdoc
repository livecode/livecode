device changes.

Introduced: 4.5.2

    -- update the marker on the map showing the current location
   updateMapPosition theLocation
end locationChanged

Parameters:
latitude:
the latitude of the device

longitude:
the longitude of the device

the altitude of the device

Description:
Handle the <locationChanged> message if you want to perform tasks when
the location of the device changes.

The <locationChanged> message is sent to the current card of the default
stack when the location of the device changes.

If location tracking cannot be started (typically due to the user 'not
allowing' access to CoreLocation) then a trackingError message is sent
instead. 

Changes:
In version 8.1 GPS behavior on iOS was changed to bring it inline with
the behavior on Android. On both platforms, the location reading 
returned by the `mobileSensorReading` function is that which was sent 
with the last system `locationChanged` event.
