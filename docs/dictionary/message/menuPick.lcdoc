Parameters:
chosenItem: The label of the menu item the user chose. If the menu item is part of a submenu, the menu item label is followed by a vertical bar (|) and the submenu's label.
submenuName: 
previousTab: The text of the menu item that was selected before the user chose a new menu item. This parameter is included only if the button's menuMode property is set to "tabbed".>*Note:* If the specification of a menu or submenu includes a tag, that tag will replace the menu label in the chosenItem parameter

Description:
Handle the <menuPick> <message> to do something when the user chooses a <menu item> from a <button menu>, or chooses a tab in a <tabbed button>.

>*Note:* If the specification of a menu or submenu includes a tag, that tag will replace the menu label in the <chosenItem> parameter

The <menuPick> <message> is sent when the user clicks a tab in a <tabbed button>, when the user chooses a <menu item> from the <menu> associated with a <button(keyword)>, or when a <button(object)|button's> <menuHistory> <property> is set by a <handler>.

The <menuPick> <message> is sent every time a <menu item> is chosen, even if the <menu> is a type that retains its state (such as an option menu) and the chosen <menu item> has not changed. (However, no <menuPick> <message> is sent when an already-chosen tab in a <tabbed button> is clicked, since no menu is displayed.)

To get the item number of the currently chosen menu item, use the menuHistory <property>.

>*Note:* The & and / characters can be used in a pulldown menu to create special effects. To be shown (instead of creating these effects), either <character> can be doubled. (For example, placing the line "This && That" in a <menu item> results in the <menu item> being displayed as "This & That", with one ampersand.) When the user chooses a <menu item> with these special characters, the <chosenItem> <parameter> is the text that appears in the menu as displayed, not the text of that line of the <button menu|menu button>.
