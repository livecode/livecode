The <mouseDoubleUp> <message> is sent to the <control> that was
<double-click|double-clicked>, or to the <card> if no <control> was
under the <mouse pointer>.

If a tool other than the Browse tool is being used, no <mouseDoubleUp>
<message> is sent. If an <unlock|unlocked> <field> is clicked with
<mouse button> 1 or 2, no <mouseDoubleUp> <message> is sent.

The <doubleClickInterval> and <doubleClickDelta> <properties> determine
what LiveCode accepts as a <double-click|double click>.

>*Important:*  If the user clicks a transparent <pixel> in an <image>,
> the <mouseDoubleUp> <message> is sent to the <object(glossary)> behind
> the <image>, not to the <image>.
