Introduced: 1.0

Description:
Handle the <mouseEnter> <message> to perform an action (for example, display additional information or <highlight> a <button(object)>) when the <mouse pointer> enters an <object>.

The <mouseEnter> <message> is sent only when the <Browse tool> is being used.

If two controls overlap, a <mouseEnter> <message> is sent whenever the <mouse pointer> crosses into a visible portion of a <control>. The <control> on the bottom receives a <mouseEnter> <message> only when the <mouse pointer> enters part of the <control> that can be seen. A <control> that is completely hidden by another <control> on top of it will never receive a <mouseEnter> <message>.

If the mouse button is down when the mouse pointer enters the control, no <mouseEnter> <message> is sent unless the mouse button is released while the pointer is still in the <control>.

If a control is shown (by changing its visible <property> to true or using the <show> <command>), and the <mouse pointer> is over the <control> when it is shown, LiveCode sends a <mouseEnter> <message> to the <control>.
