Description:
Handle the <mouseLeave> <message> to update a <control> when the <mouse pointer> moves outside it.

The <mouseLeave> <message> is sent only when the <Browse tool> is being used.

If two controls overlap, a <mouseLeave> <message> is sent whenever the <mouse pointer> crosses outside a visible portion of a <control>. The <control> on the bottom receives a <mouseLeave> <message> only when the <mouse pointer> leaves part of the <control> that can be seen. A <control> that is completely hidden by another <control> on top of it will never receive a <mouseLeave> <message>.

If the mouse button is down when the mouse pointer leaves the control, the <mouseLeave> <message> is not sent until the mouse button is released.

If a control is hidden (by changing its visible <property> to false or using the <hide> <command>), and the <mouse pointer> is over the <control> when it is hidden, LiveCode sends a <mouseLeave> <message> to the <control>.
