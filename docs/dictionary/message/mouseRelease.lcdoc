Description:
Handle the <mouseRelease> <message> to perform an action when the user releases the <mouse button> after clicking and then dragging outside the <control>.

The <mouseRelease> <message> is sent to the <control> that was originally clicked, or to the <card> if no <control> was under the <mouse pointer>.

The <mouseRelease> <message> is sent only when the <Browse tool> is being used.

If an unlocked field is clicked with mouse button 1 or 2, no <mouseRelease> <message> is sent.

If the control is a field with its listBehavior <property> set to true, the <mouseRelease> <message> is sent when the <mouse button> is released and the mouse is not over a text line in the <field>, even if the mouse is still over the <field>.

If the mouse is released while it's still within the control that was clicked, a mouseUp <message> is sent instead of <mouseRelease>.
