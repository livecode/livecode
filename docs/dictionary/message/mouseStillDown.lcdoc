Name: mouseStillDown

Type: message

Syntax: mouseStillDown <mouseButtonNumber> 

Summary: Sent periodically while the <mouse button> is being held down.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Parameters:
mouseButtonNumber (enum): The mouseButtonNumber specifies which mouse button was pressed:
-  1 is the mouse button on Mac OS systems and the left button on Windows and Unix systems.
-  2 is the middle button on Unix systems.
-  3 is the right button on Windows and Unix systems and Control-click on Mac OS systems.

Description:
You can handle the <mouseStillDown> message to perform an action when the user holds the <mouse button> down.

The <mouseStillDown> <message> is sent to the <control> that was originally clicked, or to the <card> if no <control> was under the <mouse pointer>.

The period between <mouseStillDown> <message|messages> is specified by the <idleRate> and <idleTicks> <properties>.

The <mouseStillDown> <message> is sent only when the <Browse tool> is being used. If an <unlock|unlocked> <field> is clicked with <mouse button> 1 or 2, no <mouseStillDown> <message> is sent.

Usually, it is easier and more efficient to use the mouseMove <message> to track the movement of the mouse while the <mouse button> is being held down.

>*Note:* If there is no <mouseStillDown> <handler> in the target <object|object's> <script>, no <mouseStillDown> <message> is sent, even if there is a <mouseStillDown> <handler> in an <object> that's further along the <message path>.
