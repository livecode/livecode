Syntax: moveControl

Summary: Sent to a <control> that the user moved with the <Pointer tool>.

Introduced: 1.0

-- move the same-named field to be below the moved button:
  set the topLeft of field (the short name of the target) \
     to the bottomLeft of the target
end moveControl

Description:
Handle the <moveControl> <message> if you want to respond to the user's movement of a <control>. For example, you can create a <moveControl> <handler> that responds to movement of a <button(keyword)> by moving <field|fields> out of the <button(object)|button's> way.

The <moveControl> <message> is sent only if the user moved the <control>. This message is not sent when a <handler> moves the <control> by changing its <location>, <rectangle>, or other <properties>.

The <moveControl> <message> is sent after the movement is finished. This means that you cannot prevent a <control> from being moved by <trap|trapping> this <message>.
