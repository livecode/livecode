Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

  put lineOffset(myOldName,button "Window List") into namePosition
  put myNewName into line namePosition of button "Window List"
end nameChanged

Parameters:
oldName: The object's original name.
newName: The object's new name.

Description:
Handle the <nameChanged> <message> if you want to make updates when an <object|object's> <name> is changed. For example, if you have a <popup menu> with the names of <stacks>, the <menu> should be updated when a <stack|stack's> name changes.

The actual change is not triggered by the <nameChanged> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the name from being changed.
