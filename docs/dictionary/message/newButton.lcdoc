Description:
Handle the <newButton> <message> if you want to create additional <object|objects>, switch <tool|tools>, or do other tasks when a new <button(object)> is created.

Normally, the <newButton> <message> is handled at a higher level of the <message path>, since the newly created <button(object)> does not yet have a <script> unless the <templateButton> contains one.

The actual creation is not triggered by the <newButton> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the <button(object)> from being created.
