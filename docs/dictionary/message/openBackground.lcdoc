Description:
Handle the <openBackground> message to change a group's objects, or
perform other updates, when a card with the group on it is opened.

The <openBackground> <message> is sent to background groups, if there is
more than one <group> on the <card>, the <openBackground> <message> is
sent to each one.

The <openBackground> <message> is sent after the destination <card> is
visible. To make changes that take effect before the <card> becomes
visible on the screen, use the <preOpenBackground> <message> instead.

The actual navigation is not triggered by the <openBackground>
<message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to
<pass> does not prevent the <card> with the <group> from opening.

>*Note:*  A group is only considered a background group if its
> backgroundBehavior property is set to true.
