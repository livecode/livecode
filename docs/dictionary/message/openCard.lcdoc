Description:
Handle the <openCard> <message> to change a <card(object)|card's> <object|objects>, or perform other updates, when the <card(keyword)> is visited.

The <openCard> <message> is sent after the destination <card(keyword)> is visible. To make changes that take effect before the <card(keyword)> becomes visible on the screen, use the <preOpenCard> <message> instead.

The actual navigation is not triggered by the <openCard> <message>, so <trap|trapping> the <message> and not allowing it to <pass> does not prevent the <card(keyword)> from appearing.
