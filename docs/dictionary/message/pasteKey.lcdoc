Description:
Handle the <pasteKey> <message> if you want to change the normal pasting process, or prevent use of the Paste <keyboard equivalent> without changing the <menu>.

The LiveCode development environment traps the <pasteKey> <message>, unless "Suspend LiveCode UI" is turned on in the Development menu. This means that the <pasteKey> <message> is not received by a <stack> if it's running in the <development environment>.

The <pasteKey> <message> is sent when the user presses Command-V (on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>), Control-V (on <Windows|Windows systems>), Shift-Insert (on <Unix|Unix systems>), or the keyboard Paste key.
