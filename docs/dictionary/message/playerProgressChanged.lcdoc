Handle the <playerProgressChanged> message when the loadState of the player has changed. 

You should query the <loadState> to determine which of the states have changed:
    * playable - enough data is available to start playing, but it may run out before playback finishes
    * playthrough - enough data has been buffered for playback to continue uninterrupted
    * stalled - buffer of data has stalled and playback may pause automatically if the player runs out of data

Zero or more of these are returned in a comma delimited string value.
