Name: rawKeyDown

Type: message

Syntax: rawKeyDown <keyCode>

Summary:
Sent when the user presses any key.

Associations: field

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
on rawKeyDown theKeyNumber
  if theKeyNumber is 65308 then increaseScroll -- mouse wheel down
  else if theKeyNumber is 65309 then decreaseScroll -- mouse wheel up
  else pass rawKeyDown -- don't forget this!
end rawKeyDown

Parameters:
keyCode:
The raw keycode of the pressed key.

The result:
If the <rawKeyDown> <message> is sent as the result of a keypress, the
<message> is sent to the <active (focused) control(glossary)>, or to the
<current card> if no <control> is <focus|focused>.

Description:
Handle the <rawKeyDown> <message> if you want to intercept raw
<event|events> from the keyboard, or from a mouse wheel, or if you want
to handle keys that aren't mapped to any <character>.

If the <rawKeyDown> <handler> does not <pass> the <message> or send it
to a further <object(glossary)> in the <message path>, the keypress has
no effect. <pass|Passing> the <message> allows the keypress to have its
normal effect.

A <rawKeyDown> <message> is also sent when the user moves the mouse
wheel on a scrolling mouse; in this case, the <message> is sent to the
<control> under the <mouse pointer>.

If the insertion point is in a field, the entry of typed characters is
triggered by the <rawKeyDown> <message>. This means that <trap|trapping>
the <rawKeyDown> <message> and not <pass|Passing> it prevents typing
from being entered in the <field>.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, no <message> is
> sent when a <modifier key> (Shift, Option, Control, or Command) is
> pressed, unless another key is pressed along with the <modifier key>.
> Mouse wheels do not send a <rawKeyDown> <message> on <Mac OS|Mac OS
> systems>.
