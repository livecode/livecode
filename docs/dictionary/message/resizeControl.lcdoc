Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Description:
Handle the <resizeControl> message if you want to update other <object|objects>, or do other tasks, in response to 
the user resizing a <control(glossary)>.

The <resizeControl> <message> is only sent when the user resizes a <control(glossary)> by dragging its handles. 
It is not sent if a <handler> changes the size of a <control(glossary)> by changing its <properties> (<width>, <height>, and so on).

The <resizeControl> <message> is sent after the resizing is finished. This means that you cannot prevent a 
<control(glossary)|control's> size from being changed by <trap|trapping> this <message>.
