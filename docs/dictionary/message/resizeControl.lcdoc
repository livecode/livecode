Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Description:
Handle the <resizeControl> message if you want to update other
<object|objects>, or do other tasks, in response to the user resizing a
<control(glossary)>. 

The <resizeControl> <message> is only sent when the user resizes a
<control(glossary)> by dragging its handles. It is not sent if a
<handler> changes the size of a <control(glossary)> by changing its
<properties> (<width>, <height>, and so on). 

The <resizeControl> <message> is sent after the resizing is finished.
This means that you cannot prevent a <control(glossary)|control's> size
from being changed by <trap|trapping> this <message>.
