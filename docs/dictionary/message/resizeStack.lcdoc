Name: resizeStack

Type: message

Syntax: resizeStack <newWidth>, <newHeight>, <oldWidth>, <oldHeight>

Summary:
Sent to the <current card> when the <stack window> is resized.

Associations: card

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
on resizeStack newWidth,newHeight -- put an object in the middle
  set the location of graphic "Middle" \
     to newWidth div 2,newHeight div 2
  pass resizeStack
end resizeStack

Parameters:
newWidth:
The stack's new width in pixels.

newHeight:
The stack's new height in pixels.

oldWidth:
The stack's original width in pixels.

oldHeight:
The stack's original height in pixels.

Description:
Handle the <resizeStack> <message> if you want to update the position
of <object|objects> or do other tasks when the <stack window> changes
size. 

The <resizeStack> <message> is sent when the user resizes the <stack>
by dragging its size box. It is also sent if a <handler> changes the
size of the <stack> by changing its <properties> (<width>, <height>, and
so on).

The <resizeStack> <message> is sent after the resizing is finished.
This means that you cannot prevent a <stack|stack's> size from being
changed by <trap|trapping> this <message>.

The <oldWidth> and <oldHeight> for each <resizeStack> <message> is the 
same as the <newWidth> and <newHeight> for the previous <resizeStack>. 
The <stack|stack's> original <width> and <height> are passed only with 
the first <resizeStack> <message> sent during a resize operation. 

The screen is locked while a <resizeStack> <handler> is running, so it 
is not necessary to use the <lock screen> <command> to prevent changes 
from being seen. (However, the <lockScreen> <property> is not set to 
true.)

>*Note:* If the stack's <vScroll> property is nonzero, the amount of 
> scroll is not included in the <newHeight> and <oldHeight>. This means 
> that the <parameter|parameters> of the <resizeStack> 
> <message(keyword)> are always equal to the stack's <height> before
> and 
> after resizing, regardless of the <vScroll> setting.
