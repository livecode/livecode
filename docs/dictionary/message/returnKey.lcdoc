Description:
Handle the <returnKey> <message> when you want to perform an action when the user presses Return.

The Return key (confusingly labeled "Enter" on some keyboards) is usually located above the right-hand Shift key. It is the key you press to go to a new line.

The message is sent to the active (focused) control, or to the current card if no control is focused. If there is a text selection or insertion point in a field (or a button whose menuMode is "comboBox") and the user presses Return, the <returnInField> <message> is sent instead of <returnKey>.
