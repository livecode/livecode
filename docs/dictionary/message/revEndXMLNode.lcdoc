Name: revEndXMLNode

Type: message

Syntax: revEndXMLNode <nodeName>

Summary:
Sent to the <current card> when the <revXMLCreateTreeFromFile>
<function> encounters a closing <tag> while parsing an <XML> file.

Associations: card

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Security: disk

Example:
on revEndXMLNode -- notify user how many nodes have been parsed
  global nodesProcessed
  add 1 to nodesProcessed
  put nodesProcessed && "nodes processed" into field "Progress"
end revEndXMLNode

Parameters:
nodeName (string):
A string containing the name of the XML element currently being parsed.

Description:
Handle the <revEndXMLNode> <message> if you want to build your own
subset of an <XML document>.

The revXMLCreateTree or <revXMLCreateTreeFromFile>
<function(glossary)|functions> take <XML> data and parse it. When you
<call> either of these <function(glossary)|functions>, you can specify
whether or not to send <message|messages> during the parsing operation.

If you have specified that you want the function to send messages, the
<revEndXMLNode> <message> is sent when the <function(control structure)>
encounters a close tag. If you have specified that you don't want
<message|messages> sent, no <revEndXMLNode> <message|messages> are sent.
