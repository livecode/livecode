Description:
When a stack is saved as a standalone application it is removed from memory then reopened. This message is sent to the stack after it is reopened and therefore offers the opportunity to do a last modification of the stack before saving the standalone. 

>*Note:* Changes made when you handle this message are not saved in the original stack file. They will only be seen in the standalone application.
