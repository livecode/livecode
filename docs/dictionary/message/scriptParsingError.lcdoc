Name: scriptParsingError

Type: message

Syntax: scriptParsingError <errorContents>

Summary:
Sent to an <object(glossary)> when its <script> cannot be
<compile|compiled>. 

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Parameters:
errorContents:
The errorContents specifies the details of the problem that caused the
scriptParsingError message to be sent.

The result:
>*Note:* The <scriptParsingError> message is no longer sent. Instead,
> any parse error is now put into the result immediately after setting
> the script of an object.

Description:
Handle the <scriptParsingError> <message> to prevent the standard error
window from appearing, when you want to <handle> the <error> in a custom
handler. 

The <scriptParsingError> <message> is sent when a <compile error>
occurs. If the <script> contains an <execution error>, the <errorDialog>
<message> is sent instead when the <handler> containing the <error>
attempts to run.

A list of possible compile errors is contained in the "cScriptErrors"
property of the first card of the stack "revErrorDisplay". You can view
the list with the following statement:

    answer the cScriptErrors of card 1 of stack "revErrorDisplay"


>*Note:* The exact <format> of the <errorContents> may change from
> release to release.

Changes:
The errorContents parameter was introduced in version 1.1. In previous
versions, this information was stored in the scriptError property.
