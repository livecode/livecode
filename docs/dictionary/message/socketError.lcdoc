Parameters:
socketID: The identifier (set when you opened the socket) of the socket which had an error. The socket identifier starts with the IP address of the host the socket is connected to, and may optionally include a port number (separated from the IP address by a colon). If there is more than one socket connected to that host and port, you can specify which socket by appending the connection name or number that was assigned when the socket was opened, separated from the port number by a vertical bar (|).
errorString (string): A description of the socket error.

Description:
Handle the <socketError> <message> to perform cleanup after a <socket> closes due to a problem receiving or sending data.

The <socketError> <message> is sent to the <object> that opened the <socket>.

If the socket is closed by the remote host normally, rather than due to an error, the socketClosed <message> is sent instead of <socketError>.
