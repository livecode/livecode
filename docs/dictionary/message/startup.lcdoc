Parameters:
mode: 

Description:
Handle the <startup> <message> if you want to do initialization or other tasks when the <application> starts up. 

If you are developing your application to work from a U3 compliant drive, you can use the <mode> argument to respond to U3 actions.
<mode> is one of
        *  u3install : sent when the u3p file is being installed onto the U3 drive 
        *  u3configure : sent when the application is first run from a U3 drive 
        *  u3launch : sent when the application is started from a U3 drive (after installation and configuration) 
        *  u3cleanup : sent when the LaunchPad requests the application cleans up  
        *  u3uninstall : sent when the application is being removed from the U3 drive.

The <startup> <message> is sent only when the <application> starts up, not when a <stack> is opened when the <application> is already running.

If the application is opened with multiple stacks, the <startup> message is sent to the first <stack> opened.

You will only get the U3 actions u3install, u3configure, u3cleanup and u3uninstall if the corresponding tick boxes have been checked in the advanced U3 settings of the Standalone Settings.
