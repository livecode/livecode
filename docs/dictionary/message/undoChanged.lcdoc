Sent to the <current card> when the Undo action changes.

Associations: card

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Example:
on undoChanged
  global lastFieldState

Description:
Handle the <undoChanged> <message> if you want to intercept the "Undo"
menu item, providing your own Undo stack.

Undoable actions include painting actions, deletion of objects, moving
of controls, and editing actions in a field. When the user performs one
of these actions, thus changing what happens as a result of choosing
Edit â†’ Undo from the menubar, LiveCode sends the <undoChanged> <message>
to the <current card>.
