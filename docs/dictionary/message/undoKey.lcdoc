Name: undoKey

Type: message

Syntax: undoKey

Summary: Sent when the user presses the <key combination> equivalent to the "Undo" <menu item>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,web

Example:
on undoKey
  if the optionKey is down then revert -- to last saved version
  else pass undoKey
end undoKey

Description:
Handle the <undoKey> message if you want to change the normal <Undo> process, or prevent use of the <Undo> <keyboard equivalent> without changing the menu.

The LiveCode development environment traps the <undoKey> <message>, unless "Suspend LiveCode UI" is turned on in the Development <menu>. This means that the <undoKey> <message> is not received by a <stack> if it's running in the <development environment>.

The <undoKey> <message> is sent when the user presses Command-Z (on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>), Control-Z (on <Windows|Windows systems>), Alt-Backspace (on <Unix|Unix systems>), or the keyboard <Undo> key.

The message is sent to the active (focused) control, or to the current card if no control is focused.
