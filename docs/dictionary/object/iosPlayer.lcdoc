Description:
An iosPlayer(MPMoviePlayerController) control is created using a control type of "player". 

On iOS versions prior to 4.2 you can only have a single iosPlayer in existence. Therefore on these iOS versions you can only create a single native player control at any one time, and while one is present you cannot use the <play video> command to play full screen videos.

On iOS versions 4.2 and later, while you can have multiple iosPlayer instances (and this multiple native player controls) simultaneously, only a single one can be playing at any one time. 

>*Note:* The iosPlayer control is only available on iOS 4.0 and later.

>*Note:* For full details of what the MPMoviePlayerController is capable of, and background about it see the iOS reference document.
