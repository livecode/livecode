Name: player

Type: object

Syntax: player

Summary:
A <control> that displays a movie or sound <file>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
start player "San Antone"

Example:
hide player (the selectedText of button "Current Movie")

Description:
Use the <player> <object type> to display a movie or sound from a 
separate <file>.

Unlike an audio clip or video clip, a player does not contain the movie
or sound data. Instead, you use the player's filename <property> to 
indicate the separate <file> that holds the movie or sound. This
reduces the memory required by your <stack>, because the movie or sound
data is only <loaded into memory> when it's being used, rather than
being <loaded into memory> whenever the <stack file> is open. However,
it also makes it possible for the movie or sound data to be misplaced
during distribution, since the <file> is separate from your <stack
file>. 

A player is contained in a card, group, or background. Players cannot 
contain other objects.

>*Important:*  Setting a <player|player's> filename does not 
automatically update its <currentTime> <property>. If you play a 
<movie|movie file>, then change the <player|player's> <filename> in 
order to play another, you must reset the <currentTime> to zero in
order to start from the beginning of the second <movie> :

    set the filename of player "My Player" to "SecondMovie.mov"
    set the currentTime of player "My Player" to zero
