Name: videoClip

Synonyms: vc

Type: object

Syntax: videoClip

Summary:
An <object type> that contains movie data.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
play videoClip "Spartacus"

Example:
delete videoClip ID 2485

Description:
Use the <videoClip> <object type> to display a movie that is stored in 
the <stack>, rather than in another file.

Unlike a player, a video clip contains the movie that it displays. This 
increases the memory required by your stack, because the movie data is 
loaded into memory whenever the stack file is open. However, it
prevents the movie from being accidentally separated from the stack file
and lost.

Video clips can be in QuickTime, AVI, or MPEG format.

A video clip is contained in a stack. Video clips cannot contain other 
objects. (A video clip is not a control, since it has no user interface 
and cannot be owned by a card.)

To play a <videoClip>, use the syntax 

    play videoClip <filename_of_videoclip>


To pause a videoClip, use the syntax 

    play pause videoClip <filename_of_videoclip>


To stop a videoClip, use the syntax 

    play stop videoClip <filename_of_videoclip>


Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
