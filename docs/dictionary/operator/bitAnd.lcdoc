Name: bitAnd

Type: operator

Syntax: <number1> bitAnd <number2> 

Summary: Performs a "bitwise and" <operation> on the <binary> representation of two numbers.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
0 bitAnd 1 -- evaluates to 0

Example:
3 bitAnd 2 -- in binary: 11 bitAnd 10; evaluates to 10; converted to 2

Parameters:
number1: The number1 and number2 are numbers, or expressions that evaluate to numbers, between zero and 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).
number2: 

Description:
Use the <bitAnd> <operator> to operate directly on the <bit|bits> of two numbers.

To perform the <bitAnd> <operation>, LiveCode first converts both <operand|operands> to their <binary> equivalent, a string of ones and zeroes. 1 is equivalent to true, and 0 is equivalent to false.

For each bit of <number1>, LiveCode performs an <and> <operation> with the corresponding <bit> of <number2> to produce a result. A <bit> is 1 if the corresponding <bit|bits> of <number1> and <number2> are both 1. Otherwise, the <bit> is 0.

Finally, the binary number thus created is converted back to decimal.
