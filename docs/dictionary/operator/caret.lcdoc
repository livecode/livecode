Name: ^

Type: operator

Syntax: <number> ^ <exponent> 

Summary: Raises a number to a power.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
7^3

Example:
myNumber^(1/2)

Example:
put 2^bitDepth into numberOfColors

Parameters:
number: The number and exponent are numbers, or expressions that evaluate to numbers.
exponent: 

The result: If the <exponent> is zero, the result of this <operator> is 1, regardless of what the <number> is.

Description:
Use the <^> <operator> to raise a number to a power, or to find a root of a number.

If the <exponent> is a fraction, with 1 as the numerator, the <^> <operator> finds the specified root of the <number>. For example, if the <exponent> is 1/2, the <operation> yields the square root of <number>; if the <exponent> is 1/4, the <operation> yields the 4th root of the <number>, and so on.
