Name: div

Type: operator

Syntax: <number> div <divisor> 

Summary: Divides one number by another and <return|returns> the <integer> part of the result.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
4 div 2 -- evaluates to 2

Example:
11 div 4 -- evaluates to 2 (since 11/4 = 2.75)

Example:
arrayOfNumbers div 10

Parameters:
number: A number, or an expression that evaluates to a number, or an array containing only numbers.
divisor: Any non-zero number. If the number is an array, the divisor is either a non-zero number or an array containing only non-zero numbers.

The result: >*Note:* While using non-integer <number> and <divisor> usually produces sensible results, mathematically, integer division is generally defined as a function over the integers, and the results using non-integers may not consistently be what you expect.

Description:
Use the <div> <operator> to do integer division.

If the <number> to be divided is an <array>, each of the <array> <element(glossary)|elements> must be a number. If an <array> is divided by a number, each <element(keyword)> is divided by the number. If an <array> is divided by an <array>, both <array|arrays> must have the same number of <element(glossary)|elements> and the same dimension, and each <element(keyword)> in one <array> is divided by the corresponding <element(keyword)> of the other <array>.

If an element of an array is empty, the <div> <operator> treats its contents as zero.

The expression dividend div divisor is equivalent to trunc(dividend/divisor).

If dividend can be divided evenly into <divisor>, the <expression> dividend div divisor is equal to dividend/divisor.

Attempting to divide by zero causes an execution error.

Changes:
The option to divide arrays was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, only single numbers could be used with the div operator.
