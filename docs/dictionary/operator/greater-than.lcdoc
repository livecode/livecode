Name: &gt;

Type: operator

Syntax: <value1> &gt; value2

Summary: Compares two <value(glossary)|values> and <return|returns> true if the first <value(function)> is greater than the second <value(function)>, false otherwise.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
1 &gt; 0 -- evaluates to true

Example:
2 &gt; -15 -- evaluates to true

Example:
repeat while counter &gt; 0

Parameters:
value1: The operands value1 and value2 can be numbers, literal strings of characters (delimited with double quotes), or any sources of value.

Description:
Use the <&gt;> (greater than) <operator> to compare two numbers or to compare the alphabetical order of two <string(glossary)|strings>.

When comparing strings, the  <operator> compares the two <value(glossary)|values> <character> by <character>, using the <ASCII|ASCII value> of each <character>. For example, "a" comes before "z" in the <ASCII> <character set>, so "z" &gt; "a" and "az" &gt; "ab".

If the strings are of different lengths, so that the trailing characters in one <string(keyword)> are compared to missing <characters> in the other, the missing <characters> are considered to have lower <value(function)> than any <character>. For example, "DEF" &gt; "DE".
If the two values are equal, value1 &gt; value2 evaluates to false.

If the <caseSensitive> <property> is true, the comparison between two <string(glossary)|strings> treats uppercase letters as coming before lowercase letters, so "a" &gt; "A". If the <caseSensitive> <property> is false, the comparison is not <case-sensitive>, so "a" is considered equivalent to "A".
