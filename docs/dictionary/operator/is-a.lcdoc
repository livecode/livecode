Name: is a

Type: operator

Syntax: <value> is a[n] {array | boolean | color | date | integer | number | point | rect | ASCII string }

Summary: <evaluate|Evaluates> to true if a <value> is of the specified type, false otherwise.

Synonyms: is an

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
"1/16/98" is a date -- evaluates to true

Example:
1 is a boolean -- evaluates to false

Example:
45.4 is an integer -- evaluates to false

Example:
"red" is a color -- evaluates to true

Example:
local tArray
put "test" into tArray[1] 
put tArray is an array -- evaluates to true

Example:
numToChar(128) is an ASCII string -- evaluates to false

Parameters:
value: Any source of value.

Description:
Use the <is a> <operator> to <validate> data to make sure it's the right type.

This operator is useful for checking whether the user has entered data correctly, and for checking parameters before sending them to a handler to avoid a script error caused by feeding data of one type to an operator or function that requires a different type.

A <value> is a(n):
        * array if it's <keys function> is not empty.

        * boolean or logical if it is one of the two constants true or false

        * color if it is a valid color reference

        * date if it is in one of the formats produced by the date or <time> functions

        * integer if it consists of digits (with an optional leading minus sign), or an hexadecimal number (such as 0x0F9B)

        * number if it consists of digits, optional leading minus sign, optional decimal point, and optional "E" or       "e" (scientific notation), or an optional leading minus sign and infinity or inf

        * point if it consists of two numbers separated by a comma

        * rect if it consists of four numbers separated by commas
        * ASCII string if it does not contain any characters greater than charToNum(127)

All the types other than boolean can also include leading or trailing white space characters.

>*Note:* To ensure compatibility with SuperCard stacks, the is a color operator returns true for any integer, although integers are not valid colors in LiveCode. If you need to strictly verify a color then you can write a wrapper function to do so that checks that the color is not an integer.

>*Note:* The range of dates that LiveCode can handle is limited by the operating system's date routines. In particular, Windows systems are limited to dates after 1/1/1970. This means that the is a date operator will return false for dates before 1/1/1970 on Windows.

The <is a> <operator> is the logical inverse of the <is not a> <operator>. When one is true, the other is false.

Changes:
The is an array form was added in version 2.9
