Description:
Use the <is among> operator to find out whether a string exists as an entire word, item, or line of another string.

The <valueToFind> must be a single word, item, or line (whichever chunk type you have specified). If you specify a string containing more than one chunk, the <is among> operator evaluates to false, even if all the chunks are in the <stringToSearch>.

The <is among> operator is the logical inverse of the is not among operator. When one is true, the other is false.

'is among the bytes' should be used to check if a binary strings contains the given bytes.
