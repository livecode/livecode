Description:
Use the <is not a> <operator> to <validate> data to make sure it's not the wrong type. 

This operator is useful for checking whether the user has entered data correctly, and for checking parameters before sending them to a handler to avoid a script error caused by feeding data of one type to an operator or function that requires a different type. 

A <value> is a:

* boolean or logical if it is one of the two constants true or false

* integer if it consists of digits (with an optional minus sign)

* number if it consists of digits, optional leading minus sign, optional decimal point, and optional "E" or "e" (scientific notation)

* point if it consists of two numbers separated by a comma

* rect if it consists of four numbers separated by commas

* date if it is in one of the formats produced by the date or <time> functions

* color if it is a valid color reference

* ASCII string if it does not contain any characters greater than charToNum(127)

All the types other than boolean can also include leading or trailing white space characters. 

The <is not a> <operator> is the logical inverse of the <is a> <operator>. When one is true, the other is false.
