Description:
Use the <is not among> operator to find out whether a string exists as an entire word, item, or line of another string.

The <valueToFind> must be a single word, item, or line (whichever chunk type you have specified). If you specify a string containing more than one chunk, the <is not among> operator evaluates to true, even if all the chunks are in the <stringToSearch>.

The <is not among> operator is the logical inverse of the is among operator. When one is true, the other is false.
