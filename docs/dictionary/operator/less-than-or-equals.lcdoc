Name: &lt;=

Type: operator

Syntax: <value1> &lt;= <value2>

Summary:
Compares two <value(glossary)|values> and <return|returns> true if the
first <value(function)> is less than or equal to the second
<value(function)>, false otherwise.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
22 &lt;= 21

Example:
3 &lt;= -3

Example:
"a" &lt;= "a"

Parameters:
value1:
The operands value1 and value2 can be numbers, literal strings of
characters (delimited with double quotes), or any sources of value.

value2:


Description:
Use the <&lt;=> (less than or equal to) <operator> to compare two
numbers or to compare the alphabetical order of two <string|strings>.

When comparing strings, the <&lt;=> <operator> compares the two
<value|values> <character> by <character>, using the <ASCII|ASCII value>
of each <character>. For example, "a" comes before "b" in the <ASCII>
<character set>, so the following are all true:

    "a" &lt;= "a"
    "a" &lt;= "b"
    "ab" &lt;= "bb"


If the strings are of different lengths, so that the trailing characters
in one string are compared to missing characters in the other, the
missing characters are considered to have lower value than any
character. For example, "abc" &lt;= "ab" is false.

If the <caseSensitive> <property> is true, the comparison between two
<string|strings> treats uppercase letters as coming before lowercase
letters. If the <caseSensitive> <property> is false, the comparison is
not <case-sensitive>, so "a" is considered equivalent to "A".

>*Cross-platform note:* The synonym ≤ can be used only on <OS X|OS X
> systems>. If you use a <script> containing the ≤ character on a
> <Windows> or <Unix|Unix system>, a <error|script error> may result. To
> ensure cross-platform compatibility, use the synonym <&lt;=> instead.
