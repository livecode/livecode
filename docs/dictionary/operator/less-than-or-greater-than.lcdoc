Description:
Use the <&lt;&gt;> (inequality) <operator> to compare two numbers or to compare two <string|strings>.

When comparing strings, the  &lt;&gt; operator compares the two values character by character, using the ASCII value of each character. If the caseSensitive <property> is true, the comparison between two <string|strings> treats uppercase letters as coming before lowercase letters, so "A" &lt;&gt; "a". If the caseSensitive <property> is false, the comparison is not <case-sensitive>, so "a" is considered equivalent to "A".
