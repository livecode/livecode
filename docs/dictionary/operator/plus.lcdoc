Parameters:
number1: The operands number1 and number2 are literal numbers, or expressions that evaluate to numbers, or arrays containing numbers.
number2: 

Description:
Use the <+> (plus) <operator> to add two numbers, or to add two <array|arrays> containing numbers.

To add a number to the contents of a container, use the add <command> instead.

If either <number1> or <number2> is an <array>, each of the <array> <element(glossary)|elements> must be a number. If a number is added to an <array>, the number is added to each <element(keyword)>. If an <array> is added to an <array>, both <array|arrays> must have the same number of <element(glossary)|elements> and the same dimension, and each <element(keyword)> in one <array> is added to the corresponding <element(keyword)> of the other <array>.

If an element of one array is empty, the <+> <operator> treats its contents as zero.

Changes:
The option to add arrays was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, only single numbers could be used with the + operator.
