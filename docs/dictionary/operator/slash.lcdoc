Name: /

Type: operator

Syntax: <dividend> / <divisor>

Summary:
Divides one number by another number or one array by another array.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android, html5

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
# Dividing a literal number by another
local approxPi
put 22/7 into approxPi -- approximates pi

Example:
# Dividing two variables
local thisVariable
get thisVariable/(thisVariable + 1)

Example:
# Dividing an array by another
local tNumberArray, tDivisorArray, tDividedArray
put 10 into tNumberArray[1]
put 20 into tNumberArray[2]
put 10 into tDivisorArray[1]
put 5 into tDivisorArray[2]
put tNumberArray / tDivisorArray into tDividedArray
put tDividedArray[1] & comma & tDividedArray[2]
# Yields 1,4

Parameters:
dividend:
A number or an expression that
evaluates to a number, or an array containing numbers.

divisor:
A number or an expression that
evaluates to a number, or an array containing numbers.

Description:
Use the </> (divide) <operator> to divide one number by another.

> *Note:* When used in complex arithmetic statements, 
<operator|operators> like </> follows standard rules of <precedence>.

To divide the contents of a container by a number, use the <divide>
<command> instead.

If <dividend> or <divisor> is an <array>, each of the <array>
<element(glossary)|elements> must be a number. If an <array> is divided
by a number, each <element(keyword)> is divided by the number. If an
<array> is divided by an <array>, both <array|arrays> must have the same
number of <element(glossary)|elements> and the same dimension, and each
<element(keyword)> in one <array> is divided by the corresponding
<element(keyword)> of the other <array>.

If an element of an array is empty, the </> <operator> treats its 
contents as zero.

> *Important:* Attempting to divide by zero causes an execution error.


Changes:
The option to divide arrays was introduced in version 1.1. In previous
versions, only single numbers could be used with the / operator.
