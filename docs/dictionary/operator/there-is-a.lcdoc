Type: operator

Syntax: there is a {<object> | file <filePath> | folder <folderPath> | process <procName>}

Summary: <evaluate|Evaluates> to  true if the specified <object>, <file>, <folder>, or <process> exists, false otherwise.

Example:
there is a card button 1 -- evaluates to true if any card buttons exist

Example:
if there is a card ID 3445 then go card ID 3445
put (there is a file it) into fileIsThere

Parameters:
object: Any object reference.
filePath: The filePath specifies the name and location of a file you want to check. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode looks for the file in the defaultFolder.
folderPath: The folderPath specifies the name and location of a folder you want to check. If you specify a name but not a location, LiveCode looks for the folder in the defaultFolder.
procName: The name of any process that LiveCode started.

Description:
Use the <there is a> <operator> to make sure an <object> or <file> exists before working with it, or to find out whether there are any objects of a specified type.

The <there is a> <operator> is the logical inverse of the <there is no> <operator>. When one is true, the other is false.

The expression there is a stack stackName <evaluate|evaluates> to true if the <stack> is open, if it is closed but <loaded into memory>, or if it appears in the <stackFiles> <property> of any open <stack>.

>*Tip:*  To find out whether a stack is open, check its <mode> <property>. A <stack> that is <loaded into memory> but is not open has a <mode> of zero.

>*Note:* The <there is a> <operator> is implemented internally as a <function>, and therefore has lower <precedence> than other <operator|operators>.
