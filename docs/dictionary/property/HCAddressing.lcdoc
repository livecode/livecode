Name: HCAddressing

Type: property

Syntax: set the HCAddressing of <stack> to {true | false}

Summary: Determines whether <grouped control|grouped fields> and <card control|card buttons> are assumed if the <field> or <button|button's> <domain> is not specified.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the HCAddressing of stack nextImport to true

Value (bool):The <HCAddressing> of a <stack> is true or false.
By default, the <HCAddressing> of <stacks> you create in LiveCode is set to false.

Description:
Use the <HCAddressing> <property> for compatibility with <HyperCard>.

When you open a HyperCard stack and convert it to a LiveCode stack, the new stack's <HCAddressing> <property> is set to true.

If the <HCAddressing> <property> is set to true, <expression|expressions> in the <stack's> <script|scripts> that refer to <field|fields> without specifying <card> or <background> are assumed to refer to <grouped control|grouped controls>, and <expression|expressions> that refer to other control types are assumed to refer to <card control|card controls>. For example, the number of fields reports the number of grouped fields, while button 5 refers to the fifth card button. Also, the <value|values> reported by the <long> or <abbreviated> <name> and <ID> <properties> of <controls> include "card" or "background" as the first word, depending on whether the <control(keyword)> is part of a <group>.

If the <HCAddressing> <property> is false, <expression|expressions> that refer to <field|fields> or <buttons> without specifying <card> or <background> are assumed to refer to all <field|fields> or <buttons>. For example, the number of fields reports the total number of card and <background> <field|fields>, and button 5 refers to the fifth button.

If a stack's <HCAddressing> <property> is true, the <style> <property> of a <button(keyword)> whose style is "menu" reports "popup" instead. This is because HyperCard uses a style setting of "popup" to designate popup menus.
