Name: JPEGQuality

Type: property

Syntax: set the JPEGQuality to <qualityNumber> 

Summary: Specifies the quality level of <JPEG> <image|images> created by LiveCode.

Introduced: 1.1

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the JPEGQuality to 40

Example:
set the JPEGQuality to the JPEGQuality - 10

Value:
The <JPEGQuality> is an integer between 1 and 100.
By default, the <JPEGQuality> <property> is set to 100.

Description:
Use the <JPEGQuality> <property> to control the file size and sharpness of <JPEG> <files> created with the <export> <command>.

JPEG compression is inherently lossy, which means some detail is always lost when an image is compressed using this method. The <JPEGQuality> <property> controls how much detail is lost. If the <JPEGQuality> is 100, as much detail as possible is retained.

In general, the lower the quality setting, the smaller the file size. Photographic images with naturally fuzzy edges generally do not suffer much visible loss of quality with a <JPEGQuality> setting of 50 or higher. Different <image(object)|images> may require different levels of this property to achieve acceptable results.

The <JPEGQuality> setting is used when a <file> is exported in <JPEG> format using the <export> <command>, and when an <image(keyword)> whose <paintCompression> <property> is "jpeg" is changed.
