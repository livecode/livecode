Value: The <RTFText> of a field is a string.

Description:
Use the <RTFText> property to import and export text in RTF format.

The <RTFText> property is a representation of the styled text of the field in RTF format.

Setting the <RTFText> of a field (or a chunk of a field) sets both the text contents and the font, size, style, and color attributes corresponding to the information in the <RTFString>. Any other formatting controls in the <RTFstring> are ignored.

The <RTFText> property interprets the following RTF formatting controls:
Colors:  \cf, \colortbl, \red, \green, \blue, \highlight
Styles:  \plain, \b, \i, \ul, \ulnon, \strike, \dn, \up
Font and character set:  \fcharset, \ansi, \mac, \pc, \pca, \u, \fonttbl, \f, \fs
Others:  \header, \par, \line, \tab

Getting the <RTFText> property reports a string consisting of the text of the field (or chunk of a field), with any font, size, style, and color properties embedded in the text in the form of RTF control words. Unicode text is supported.

Paragraphs with a non-empty listStyle are appropriately marked in <rtfText> using both the (legacy) pn family of paragraph numbering tags and also with the new listtable tags.

By using both sets of tags a reasonable degree of interoperability is achieved with both TextEdit (and other Cocoa applications) on Mac, and Word and WordPad on Windows. 
>*Note:* Unfortunately, OpenOffice does not have particularly good rtf import / export capabilities (it doesn't even round-trip correctly through itself!) and thus copying / pasting of lists between LiveCode and OpenOffice will not work reliably or correctly.
>*Important:* Because the RTF standard does not include the box, threeDbox, and link styles supported by LiveCode, the <RTFText> property does not necessarily include all information necessary to reproduce the style information in a chunk. To export and re-import field information without losing any style information, use the htmlTextproperty instead.
