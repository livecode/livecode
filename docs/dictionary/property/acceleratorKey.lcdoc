Syntax: set the accel[erator]Key of <button> to {empty | <letterChar>}

Summary: Specifies a shortcut <key combination> for a <button|button's> <mouseUp> <handler>.

Synonyms: accelKey

Example:

Value:
The <acceleratorKey> of a <button> is a single lowercase letter from a to z, or a key name. Setting the <acceleratorKey> to empty removes the shortcut.
By default, the <acceleratorKey> of a newly created <button> is empty.

Description:
Use the <acceleratorKey> <property> to give users a shortcut <key combination> for often-used <button(object)|buttons>, or to provide a <keyboard equivalent|keyboard shortcut> to a <button(keyword)> that's used as a <menu item> in a <stack menu>.

Press the key combination defined in a button's <acceleratorKey> <property> to send a <mouseUp> message to the <button(keyword)>, instead of clicking.

The key(s) specified in the acceleratorModifiers <property> must be pressed along with the <acceleratorKey>.

>*Important:*  The <acceleratorKey> <property> is <case-sensitive>. You must specify a lowercase letter as the <letterChar>; the uppercase letter is not equivalent.

If the insertion point is in a field, the keypress is sent to the field, and the button does not receive it.

On Unix systems, the key names are listed in the file "/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h". Don't include the "XK_" prefix in these key names; for example, use "F8" for the key designated as "XK_F8" in the file.
