Name: allowFieldRedraw

Type: property

Syntax: set the allowFieldRedraw to {true | false}

Summary:
Has no effect and is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with
imported <SuperCard> projects.

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop, server

Description:
In SuperCard, the <allowFieldRedraw> <property> determines whether
scrolling <field|fields> are <redraw|redrawn> after scrolling. In
LiveCode, scrolling <field|fields> are always <redraw|redrawn>.

The <allowFieldRedraw> <property> is always set to false. A <handler>
can set it to any value without causing a <error|script error>, but the
actual <value> is not changed.
