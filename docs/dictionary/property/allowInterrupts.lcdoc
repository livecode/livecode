Name: allowInterrupts

Type: property

Syntax: set the allowInterrupts to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether the user can halt a <handler> with a <key
combination>. 

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the allowInterrupts to false

Example:
set the allowInterrupts to the hilite of button 1

Value (bool):
The <allowInterrupts> property is true or false.
By default, the <allowInterrupts> <property> is true.

Description:
Use the allowInterrrupts <property> to prevent users from interrupting
<handler|handlers> that must run to completion. For example, some
<handler|handlers> that change data cannot be interrupted safely,
because they will leave data in an inconsistent state if interrupted.

If the <allowInterrupts> <property> is set to true, the user can halt
<handler|handlers> by typing Control-period or Control-break (on
<Windows> or <Unix>) or Command-period (on <Mac OS>). Setting this
<property> to false disables this capability and ensures that the user
cannot interrupt a handler.

If the <allowInterrupts> <property> is set to false and the user
attempts to interrupt the <handler>, the <interrupt> function
<return|returns> true. To provide a clean <exit>, check this function
and do any needed cleanup tasks before <exit|exiting> the <handler>.

Setting the <allowInterrupts> <property> to false is functionally
equivalent to setting the <cantAbort> <property> to true for each open
<stack>. 

>*Warning:*  Before setting the <allowInterrupts> <property> to false,
> make sure all <handler|handlers> that may be affected have been
> thoroughly tested. If <allowInterrupts> is set to false, you cannot
> interrupt a runaway <handler> with the standard <key combination>.
