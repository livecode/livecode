Description:
In SuperCard, the <allowKeyInField> <property> determines whether a "keyInField" <message> is sent when a key is pressed while the <insertion point> is in a <field>.

In LiveCode, the "keyInField" message is not sent.

The <allowKeyInField> <property> is always true. A <handler> can set it to any value without causing a <error|script error>, but the actual <value> is not changed.
