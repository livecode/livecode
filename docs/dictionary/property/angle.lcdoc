Name: angle

Type: property

Syntax: set the angle of {<graphic> | <image>} to <angleInDegrees> 

Summary: Specifies the starting angle of an arc or the rotation angle of a <regular polygon> or <image>.

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the angle of graphic "Triangle" to 180

Example:
set the angle of image ID 45902 to it

Example:
set the angle of graphic myGraphic to the angle of myGraphic + 5

Value:
The <angle> of a <graphic> or <image> is an <integer> between zero and 360.
By default, the <angle> <property> of a newly created <graphic> or <image> is zero.

Description:
Use the <angle> <property> to create an arc shape, or to turn a <regular polygon> or <image> object.

If you specify an <angleInDegrees> greater than 360, the <angle> is set to the number you specify mod 360.

A regular polygon can be rotated between zero and 360. Increasing the <angleInDegrees> rotates the polygon clockwise. You can specify the <angle> of a <graphic(keyword)> that is not a <regular polygon>, but it has no effect on the <graphic(object)|graphic's> appearance.

An image can be rotated between zero and 360. Increasing the <angleInDegrees> rotates the <image> counterclockwise. Unlike the <rotate> <command>, the <angle> <property> affects only the screen display of the <image>, not the actual picture data in it. Changing an <image(object)|image's> <angle> does not change the <imageData> of the <image>. Repeated changes to the <angle> <property>, unlike repeated uses of the <rotate> <command>, do not degrade the <image(object)|image's> quality. The <rotate> <command> cannot be used on a <referenced control|referenced image>, but the <angle> of a <referenced control|referenced image> can be set.

By default, oval graphics display their entire arc from zero to 360, forming a complete oval. You can use the <angle> and <arcAngle> <properties> to specify a portion of the oval to be displayed. The <angle> <property> determines the starting point of the arc. Zero is at the right edge, 3 o'clock. Increasing the <angle> moves the starting point counter-clockwise around the arc. (The direction of rotation for an arc is opposite the direction of rotation for a polygon.) For example, if the <angle> is 90, the arc starts at the top edge of the graphic's rectangle, 12 o'clock.

>*Note:* For an oval, the <angle> is the same as the <startAngle>. Changing one changes the other.

Changes:
The ability to set the angle of an image was introduced in version 2.0. In previous versions, the angle property applied only to graphics.
