Name: arcAngle

Type: property

Syntax: set the arcAngle [of <graphic>] to <angleInDegrees> 

Summary: Specifies the angle used to draw an arc.

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the arcAngle to myAngle -- affects ovals drawn with the paint tools

Example:
set the arcAngle of graphic "Over" to theAngle

Value:
The <arcAngle> of a <graphic> is an <integer> between zero and 360.
By default, the <arcAngle> <property> of a newly created <graphic> is 360.

Description:
Use the <arcAngle> <property> to create an arc shape from an oval <graphic>, or to cause the Oval <paint tool> to draw arcs.

By default, ovals display their entire arc from zero to 360, forming a complete oval. Use the <startAngle> and <arcAngle> <properties> to specify that only a portion of the oval, forming an arc, should be drawn.

The <arcAngle> determines how much of the oval is used to form the arc, from zero (no arc) to 360 (a full oval). For example, if the <angleInDegrees> is 90, a quarter-oval arc is displayed.

The global setting of the <arcAngle> <property> controls the appearance of arcs drawn with the <paint tool|paint tools>. Once a paint arc is drawn, its appearance cannot be changed by changing the <global> <arcAngle> <property>.
