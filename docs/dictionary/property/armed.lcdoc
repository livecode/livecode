Description:
Check the <armed> <property> to determine whether a <button(object)|button's> <menu> is open--that is, whether the user is in the process of choosing an item from the <menu>. You can also set a <button(object)|button's> <armed> <property> to change its <appearance>.

A button's <armed> <property> is analogous to its <hilite> <property>. A <button(keyword)> is usually <armed> when the <mouse pointer> moves into it. You can automate this behavior by setting the <button(object)|button's> <autoArm> <property> to true.

The appearance of an armed button is determined by its armBorder and <armFill> <properties>.

Changes:
The armed keyword was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the arm synonym was used.
