Name: arrowSize

Type: property

Syntax: set the arrowSize of <graphic> to <size> 

Summary: Specifies the size of an an arrow at one end of a <line> or <polygon> <graphic>.

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 1.0

Value:
The <arrowSize> of a <graphic(keyword)> is a number between 1 and 65535.
By default, the <arrowSize> <property> of newly created <graphic(object)|graphics> is set to 3.

Description:
Use the <arrowSize> <property> to change the size of arrows at the ends of <lines> and <polygon|polygons>.

The arrow of a graphic is proportional to the graphic's <lineSize>; changing the <lineSize> increases or decreases the size of the arrow, although the <graphic|graphic's> <arrowSize> <property> is not changed. If the <lineSize> is zero, the arrow is not visible.

Set the <startArrow> or <endArrow> <properties> to true to make the arrows visible.

You can set the <arrowSize> of <graphic|graphics> other than <lines> and <polygon|polygons>, but doing so has no effect.
