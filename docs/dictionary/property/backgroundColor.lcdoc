rgbColor:
Consists of three comma-separated integers between zero and 255,
specifying the level of each of red, green, and blue; or an HTML-style
color consisting of a hash mark (#) followed by three hexadecimal
numbers, one for each of red, green, and blue.

Description:
Use the <backgroundColor> <property> to change the background of a
window, or the color that fills an <object(glossary)>, or to change the
background color of text for a <highlight|highlighted> effect.

By default, the <backgroundColor> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Setting the <backgroundColor> of an <object(glossary)> to empty allows
the <backgroundColor> of the <object|object's> <owner(property)> to show
through. Use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what color is used
for the <object(glossary)>, even if its own <backgroundColor> is empty.

If an object's backgroundPattern is set, the pattern is shown instead of
the color specified by <backgroundColor>. The setting of the
<backgroundColor> <property> has different effects, depending on the
<object type>:

* The <backgroundColor> of a <stack> or <card> fills the entire <stack
  window>, as well as determining the <backgroundColor> of each
  <object(glossary)> in the <stack> or <card> that does not have its own
  <backgroundColor>. 


>*Cross-platform note:* On <Mac OS>, <OS X>, and <Windows|Windows
> systems>, if the <backgroundColor> of all <object|objects> in the
> <object hierarchy> is empty, the background color set by the system is
> used. 

* The <backgroundColor> of a group determines the <backgroundColor> of
  each <object(glossary)> in the <group> that does not have its own
  <backgroundColor>. 


* The <backgroundColor> of a button fills the area inside the
  <button(object)|button's> outline. If the button's <style> is
  "checkbox", the <backgroundColor> fills the checkbox. If the
  <button(object)|button's> style is "radioButton", the
  <backgroundColor> has no effect. If the <button(keyword)> is a <tabbed
  button>, the <backgroundColor> fills the tab area and the frontmost
  tab, but does not affect the other tabs.


>*Cross-platform note:* If the <lookAndFeel> is set to
> "Appearance Manager", standard and rectangle <button(object)|buttons>
> are drawn by the operating system if the <backgroundColor> and
> <backgroundPattern> of the <button(keyword)> is empty. (In this case,
> none of the <button(object)|button's> color <property|properties> have
> an effect except for the <foregroundColor> or <foregroundPattern>.)
> Otherwise, the <button(keyword)> is drawn by LiveCode. If the
> <lookAndFeel> is "Appearance Manager", <button menu|button menus>
> whose <menuMode> is set to "option" or "comboBox" are always drawn by
> the operating system, and the setting of the <backgroundColor> does
> not affect them.

* The <backgroundColor> of a <field(keyword)> fills the area inside the
  <field(object)|field's> outline. If you set the <backgroundColor> of a
  <chunk> of a <field(keyword)>, only that <chunk> is affected. For
  example, to create a "highlighter pen" effect on a single
  <word(keyword)>, set the <word(glossary)|word's> <backgroundColor> to
  yellow. If a <chunk> of text contains runs of text with more than one
  background color, the <backgroundColor> of that <chunk> reports
  "mixed". 


If a field's <backgroundColor> is empty and the <lookAndFeel> <property>
is set to "Macintosh", "Appearance Manager", or "Windows 95", the
<field(keyword)> background is white, instead of inheriting its
<owner(glossary)|owner's> color.

* The <backgroundColor> of a <scrollbar> fills the arrow boxes at the
  ends of the <scrollbar>.


* The <backgroundColor> of a <graphic(keyword)> is displayed inside the
  <graphic(object)|graphic's> border if the <graphic(object)|graphic's>
  fill <property> is true. If the <graphic(object)|graphic's> fill is
  false, the setting of the <backgroundColor> has no effect.


* The <backgroundColor> of an <EPS|EPS object> fills the
  <object|object's> rectangle.


* The <backgroundColor> of an <image(keyword)> is the second color in
  the <image(object)|image's> <color palette>.


* The <backgroundColor> of a <player>, <audio clip>, or <video clip> has
  no effect.


The ability to use the system background color was introduced in version
1.1. In previous versions, if the <backgroundColor> of all
<object|objects> in the <object hierarchy> was empty, a light gray color
was used.

Changes:
The ability of standard buttons to have a <backgroundColor> under
Appearance Manager was introduced in version 2.0. In previous versions,
if the <lookAndFeel> was set to "Appearance Manager", the setting of the
<backgroundColor> had no effect on standard <button|buttons>.
