Name: borderPattern

Type: property

Syntax: set the borderPattern of <object> to {empty | <patternNumber> | <imageID>}

Summary:
Specifies the pattern of an <object|object's> border.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the borderPattern of group "Nav" to myPattern

Value:
The <borderPattern> of an <object(glossary)> is a pattern specifier.
A <patternNumber> is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164. These
patterns are provided for compatability with patterns available in
MetaCard and correspond to LiveCode's built in image id 137 to 300. As
with MetaCard pattern numbers 105 to 114 and 146 and above are 
unavailable.

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode
looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in
other open <stacks>.

By default, the <borderPattern> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Use the <borderPattern> <property> to specify the border pattern of a
<button(keyword)> or <scrollbar>.

Pattern images can be color or black-and-white.

>*Cross-platform note:*  To be used as a pattern on <Mac OS|Mac OS
> systems>, an <image> must be 128x128 <pixels> or less, and both its
> <height> and <width> must be a power of 2. To be used on <Windows> and
> <Unix|Unix systems>, <height> and <width> must be divisible by 8. To
> be used as a fully cross-platform pattern, both an image's dimensions
> should be one of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.

The <borderPattern> of <control(object)|controls> is drawn starting at
the <control(object)|control's> upper right corner: if the
<control(keyword)> is moved, the pattern does not shift.

Setting the <borderPattern> of an <object(glossary)> to empty allows the
<borderPattern> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show through. Use
the <effective> <keyword> to find out what color is used for the
<object(glossary)>, even if its own <borderPattern> is empty.

If the object's showBorder <property> is false, the <borderPattern> has
no effect.

The setting of the <borderPattern> <property> has different effects,
depending on the <object type>:

* The <borderPattern> of a <stack>, <card>, or <group> determines the
  <borderPattern> of each <object(glossary)> in the <stack>, <card>, or
  <group> that does not have its own <borderPattern>.


* The <borderPattern> of a <button(keyword)> determines the pattern of
  the border around the <button(keyword)>. If the
  <button(object)|button's> <style> is checkbox or radioButton, the
  <borderPattern> has no effect. If the <button(keyword)> is a <button
  menu>, the <borderPattern> has no effect unless the
  <button(object)|button's> <menuMode> <property> is set to comboBox or
  popup. If the button's <threeD> <property> is set to true, the
  <borderPattern> has no effect regardless of the
  <button(object)|button's> <style>.


* The <borderPattern> of a <field(keyword)> has no effect, except for
  the border around a scrolling <field(object)|field's> scrollbar. The
  <field(object)|field's> <borderPattern> also determines the pattern of
  the outline around any text in the <field(keyword)> whose <textStyle>
  is set to "box".


* The <borderPattern> of a <scrollbar> determines the pattern of the
  border surrounding the <scrollbar>.


* The <borderPattern> of a <graphic>, <audio clip>, <video clip>, or
  <image> has no effect.


* The <borderPattern> of a <player> or <EPS> <object(glossary)>
  determines the pattern of the border around the <object(glossary)>. If
  the <object|object's> <threeD> <property> is set to true, the
  <borderPattern> has no effect.


If an object's <borderPattern> is set, the pattern is shown instead of
the color specified by <borderColor>.
