Value:
The <bottom> of an <object> is an integer. A <negative> <integer> indicates that the position is above the top of the screen or <card> (and therefore cannot be seen).
A stack's <bottom> is the distance in <pixels> from the top edge of the screen.

A card's or control's <bottom> is the distance in <pixels> from the top edge of the <card> to the bottom edge of the <card> or <control>.

Description:
Use the <bottom> <property> to change the vertical placement of a <control> or window.

The <bottom> of a <stack> is in <absolute (screen) coordinates(glossary)>. The <bottom> of a <card> is always equal to the height of the <stack window>; setting the <bottom> of a <card> does not cause a <error|script error>, but it has no effect. The <bottom> of a <group> or <control> is in <relative (window) coordinates(glossary)>.

Changing the <bottom> of an <object> shifts it to the new position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> height, set its height or <rectangle> <property>.

The <height> <property> of an <object> is equal to its <bottom> minus its <top>.
