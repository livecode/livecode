Value:
The <bottomLeft> of an <object(glossary)> is any expression that
<evaluate|evaluates> to a <point> --two <integer|integers> separated by
a comma. The first item of the <bottomLeft> is the distance in <pixels>
from the left edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> to the left
edge of the <object(glossary)>. The second <item> is the distance in
<pixels> from the top edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> to the
bottom edge of the <object(glossary)>.

For cards, the <bottomLeft> <property> is <read-only> and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <bottomLeft> <property> to change the placement of a <control>
or window.

The <bottomLeft> of a stack is in 
<absolute coordinates(glossary)|absolute (screen) coordinates>. 
The first <item> (the <left>) of a <card|card's>
<bottomLeft> <property> is always zero; the second <item> (the <bottom>)
is always the height of the <stack window>. The <bottomLeft> of a group
or control is in 
<relative coordinates(glossary)|relative (window) coordinates>.

In window coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the stack
window. In screen coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the
screen. 

Changing the <bottomLeft> of an <object(glossary)> moves it to the new
position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> size, set
its <height>, <width>, or <rectangle> <properties>.

>*Important:*  The order of the <bottom> and <left>
> <parameter|parameters> is reversed compared to the <property> name:
> left comes first, then bottom.
