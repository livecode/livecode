Associations: stack,card,field,button,graphic,scrollbar,player,image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the bottomPattern of scrollbar 2 to 4934

Example:

Value:
The <bottomPattern> of an <object> is a pattern specifier.
A patternNumber is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164. (These patterns correspond to LiveCode's built-in patterns 136 to 300.)

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in other open <stacks>.

By default, the <bottomPattern> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Objects whose threeD <property> is set to true appear to stick out of or recede into the screen. Use the <bottomPattern> <property> to specify the color of the shadowed edge of the <object>.

Pattern images can be color or black-and-white.

>*Cross-platform note:*  To be used as a pattern on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, an <image> must be 128x128 <pixels> or less, and both its <height> and <width> must be a power of 2. To be used on <Windows> and <Unix|Unix systems>, <height> and <width> must be divisible by 8. To be used as a fully cross-platform pattern, both an image's dimensions should be one of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.

The <bottomPattern> of <control(object)|controls> is drawn starting at the <control(object)|control's> upper right corner: if the <control(keyword)> is moved, the pattern does not shift.

Setting the <bottomPattern> of an <object> to empty allows the <bottomPattern> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show through. Use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what pattern is used for the <object>, even if its own <bottomPattern> is empty.

If the object's showBorder <property> is false, the <bottomPattern> has no effect.

The setting of the <bottomPattern> <property> has different effects, depending on the <object type>:

* The <bottomPattern> of a <stack> determines the <bottomPattern> of each <object> in the <stack> that does not have its own <bottomPattern>.

* The <bottomPattern> of a <card> or <group> determines the pattern of the border around the <card> or <group>, as well as determining the <bottomPattern> of each <object> in the <card> or <group> that does not have its own <bottomPattern>.

* The <bottomPattern> of a <button> forms a border on the bottom and right edges of the <button>. If the button"s <threeD> <property> is false, the <bottomPattern> has no effect.

* The <bottomPattern> of a <field(keyword)> forms a border on the top and left edges of the <field(keyword)> and (if the <field(keyword)> is a scrolling <field(keyword)>) the bottom and right edges of the arrow boxes at the ends of the scrollbar and the top and left edges of the scroll area. The <field(object)|field's> <bottomPattern> also determines the pattern of the bottom and right edges of any text in the <field(keyword)> whose <textStyle> is set to "threeDBox". If the <field(object)|field's> <threeD> <property> is false, the <field(keyword)> border is not affected.

* The <bottomPattern> of a <scrollbar> forms a border on the bottom and right edges of the arrow boxes at the ends of the <scrollbar>, and the top and left edges of the scroll area.

* The <bottomPattern> of a <graphic>, <audio clip>, <video clip>, or <image> has no effect.

* The <bottomPattern> of a <player> or <EPS> <object> forms a border on the top and left edges of the <object>. If the <object|object's> <threeD> <property> is false, the <bottomPattern> has no effect.

If an object's <bottomPattern> is set, the pattern is shown instead of the color specified by the <bottomColor>.
