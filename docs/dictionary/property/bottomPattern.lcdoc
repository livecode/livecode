Name: bottomPattern

Type: property

Syntax: set the bottomPattern of <object> to {empty | <patternNumber> | <imageID>}

Summary:
Specifies the pattern of a three-D <object|object's> lowered edge.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the bottomPattern of scrollbar 2 to 4934

Example:
set the bottomPattern of button "OK" to savedPattern

Value:
The <bottomPattern> of an <object(glossary)> is a pattern specifier.
A <patternNumber> is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164. These
patterns are provided for compatability with patterns available in
MetaCard and correspond to LiveCode's built in image id 137 to 300. As
with MetaCard pattern numbers 105 to 114 and 146 and above are 
unavailable.

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode
looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in
other open <stacks>.

By default, the <bottomPattern> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Objects whose threeD <property> is set to true appear to stick out of or
recede into the screen. Use the <bottomPattern> <property> to specify
the color of the shadowed edge of the <object(glossary)>.

Pattern images can be color or black-and-white.

>*Cross-platform note:*  To be used as a pattern on <Mac OS|Mac OS
> systems>, an <image> must be 128x128 <pixels> or less, and both its
> <height> and <width> must be a power of 2. To be used on <Windows> and
> <Unix|Unix systems>, <height> and <width> must be divisible by 8. To
> be used as a fully cross-platform pattern, both an image's dimensions
> should be one of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.

The <bottomPattern> of <control(object)|controls> is drawn starting at
the <control(object)|control's> upper right corner: if the
<control(keyword)> is moved, the pattern does not shift.

Setting the <bottomPattern> of an <object(glossary)> to empty allows the
<bottomPattern> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show through. Use
the <effective> <keyword> to find out what pattern is used for the
<object(glossary)>, even if its own <bottomPattern> is empty.

If the object's showBorder <property> is false, the <bottomPattern> has
no effect.

The setting of the <bottomPattern> <property> has different effects,
depending on the <object type>:

* The <bottomPattern> of a <stack> determines the <bottomPattern> of
  each <object(glossary)> in the <stack> that does not have its own
  <bottomPattern>. 


* The <bottomPattern> of a <card> or <group> determines the pattern of
  the border around the <card> or <group>, as well as determining the
  <bottomPattern> of each <object(glossary)> in the <card> or <group>
  that does not have its own <bottomPattern>.


* The <bottomPattern> of a <button> forms a border on the bottom and
  right edges of the <button>. If the button"s <threeD> <property> is
  false, the <bottomPattern> has no effect.


* The <bottomPattern> of a <field(keyword)> forms a border on the top
  and left edges of the <field(keyword)> and (if the <field(keyword)> is
  a scrolling <field(keyword)>) the bottom and right edges of the arrow
  boxes at the ends of the scrollbar and the top and left edges of the
  scroll area. The <field(object)|field's> <bottomPattern> also
  determines the pattern of the bottom and right edges of any text in
  the <field(keyword)> whose <textStyle> is set to "threeDBox". If the
  <field(object)|field's> <threeD> <property> is false, the
  <field(keyword)> border is not affected.


* The <bottomPattern> of a <scrollbar> forms a border on the bottom and
  right edges of the arrow boxes at the ends of the <scrollbar>, and the
  top and left edges of the scroll area.


* The <bottomPattern> of a <graphic>, <audio clip>, <video clip>, or
  <image> has no effect.


* The <bottomPattern> of a <player> or <EPS> <object(glossary)> forms a
  border on the top and left edges of the <object(glossary)>. If the
  <object|object's> <threeD> <property> is false, the <bottomPattern>
  has no effect.


If an object's <bottomPattern> is set, the pattern is shown instead of
the color specified by the <bottomColor>.
