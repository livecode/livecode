Value:
The <bottomRight> of an <object(glossary)> is any expression that
<evaluate|evaluates> to a <point> --two <integer|integers> separated by
a comma. The first item of the <bottomRight> is the distance in <pixels>
from the left edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> to the right
edge of the <object(glossary)>. The second <item> is the distance in
<pixels> from the top edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> to the
bottom edge of the <object(glossary)>.

For cards, the <bottomRight> <property> is <read-only> and cannot be
set. 

Description:
Use the <bottomRight> <property> to change the placement of a <control>
or window.

The <bottomRight> of a <stack> is in <absolute (screen)
coordinates(glossary)>. The first <item> (the <right>) of a
<card|card's> <bottomRight> <property> is always the width of the <stack
window>; the second <item> (the <bottom>) is always the height of the
<stack window>. The <bottomRight> of a <group> or <control> is in
<relative (window) coordinates(glossary)>.

In window coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the stack
window. In screen coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the
screen. 

Changing the <bottomRight> of an <object(glossary)> moves it to the new
position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> size, set
its <height>, <width>, or <rectangle> <properties>.

>*Important:*  The order of the bottom and right <parameter|parameters>
> is reversed compared to the <property> name: right comes first, then
> bottom.
