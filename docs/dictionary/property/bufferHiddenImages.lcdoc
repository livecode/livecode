Name: bufferHiddenImages

Type: property

Syntax: set the bufferHiddenImages to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether <image|images> that are not visible are decompressed into an offscreen <buffer>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the bufferHiddenImages to true

Value (bool):The <bufferHiddenImages> is true or false.
By default, the <bufferHiddenImages> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <bufferHiddenImages> <property> to eliminate delays when hidden <image(object)|images> are shown.

If the <bufferHiddenImages> <property> is set to true, hidden <image(object)|images> are decompressed (along with visible <image(object)|images>) when the user goes to a <card>. This means the <image(keyword)> is shown immediately when its <visible> <property> is set to true, without waiting for decompression, but it uses more memory.

If the <bufferHiddenImages> is false, hidden <image(object)|images> are not decompressed until they are made visible.

If the alwaysBuffer <property> of an <image(keyword)> is true, the setting of the <bufferHiddenImages> <property> has no effect on that <image(keyword)>, and it is always decompressed immediately.
