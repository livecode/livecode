Name: cantDelete

Type: property

Syntax: set the cantDelete of {<card> | <group> | <stack>} to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether an <object> can be deleted.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the cantDelete of this card to true

Value (bool):The <cantDelete> of a <card>, <background>, or <stack> is true or false.
By default, the <cantDelete> <property> of newly created <objects> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <cantDelete> <property> to protect a <stack> or part of a <stack> against accidental deletion.

If an object's <cantDelete> <property> is set to true, the <object> cannot be deleted either by user action or by a <handler>. If you want to delete the <object>, you must first set its <cantDelete> to false.

Deleting a card, background, or substack removes it permanently if the stack is saved after the deletion. Deleting a main stack removes it from memory, but does not remove its file from the user's system.

Setting a stack's <cantDelete> <property> to true does not prevent the user from deleting the <file> containing the stack by putting it in the Trash or Recycle Bin, or deleting it with a <shell> command or system script.
