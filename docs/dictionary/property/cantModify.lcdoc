Name: cantModify

Type: property

Syntax: set the cantModify of <stack> to { true | false }

Summary: Specifies whether the user can make changes to a <stack>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the cantModify of stack "Help" to true

Value (bool):The <cantModify> of a stack is true or false.
By default, the <cantModify> <property> of newly created <stacks> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <cantModify> <property> to protect the <object|objects> in a <stack> from changes.

If a stack's <cantModify> <property> is set to true, the user cannot choose any <tool> except the <Browse tool>. This prevents the user from moving, resizing, creating, or deleting <object|objects>.

If a stack's <cantModify> is false and its <label> <property> is empty, an asterisk (*) appears in the <stack|stack's> <title bar>, indicating that the <stack> can be modified.

The <cantModify> <property> restricts user actions, but does not affect actions performed by a <handler>. To prevent either user action or a <handler> from deleting a <card>, <group>, or <stack>, use the <cantDelete> <property>.

>*Important:*  If a modifiable <stack> is open in an <editable window>, the modifiable <stack> takes precedence over any non-modifiable stacks, because its <modeproperty> is lower. This means that menu items (such as Object menu<img src="202656"/>Stack Properties) that act on the current s may not be able to operate correctly with a stack whose cantModify is set to true as long as another, modifiable stack is open.
