Name: cantModify

Type: property

Syntax: set the cantModify of <stack> to { true | false }

Summary:
Specifies whether the user can make changes to a <stack>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the cantModify of stack "Help" to true

Value (bool):
The <cantModify> of a stack is true or false.
By default, the <cantModify> <property> of newly created <stacks> is set
to false.

Description:
Use the <cantModify> <property> to protect the <object|objects> in a
<stack> from changes.

If a stack's <cantModify> <property> is set to true, the user cannot
choose any <tool> except the <Browse tool>. This prevents the user from
moving, resizing, creating, or deleting <object|objects>.

If a stack's <cantModify> is false and its <label> <property> is empty,
an asterisk (*) appears in the <stack|stack's> <title bar>, indicating
that the <stack> can be modified.

The <cantModify> <property> restricts user actions, but does not affect
actions performed by a <handler>. To prevent either user action or a
<handler> from deleting a <card>, <group>, or <stack>, use the
<cantDelete> <property>.

>*Important:*  If a modifiable <stack> is open in an <editable window>,
> the modifiable <stack> takes precedence over any non-modifiable
> stacks, because its <mode> <property> is lower. This means that menu
> items (such as Object â†’ Stack Properties) that act on the current
> stack may not be able to operate correctly with a stack whose
> cantModify is set to true as long as another, modifiable stack is
> open.
