Name: caseSensitive

Type: property

Syntax: set the caseSensitive to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether comparisons treat uppercase and lowercase letters as different.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the caseSensitive to true

Value (bool):The <caseSensitive> is true or false. 
By default, the <caseSensitive> <property> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <caseSensitive> <property> to control the behavior of text comparisons.

The <caseSensitive> <property> <control|controls> the <behavior> of the all <string> comparisons, including the comparison <operator|operators> <=>, &gt;, &lt; , &gt;=, &lt;=, <is in>, <is among>, <is not among>, and <contains>; the <command|commands> <filter>, <find>, and <replace>; and the <function|functions> <offset>, <itemOffset>, <wordOffset>, <lineOffset>, and <replaceText>. 

If the <caseSensitive> <property> is set to true, all the <LiveCode> terms listed above, as well as all other <string> comparisons, treat uppercase and lowercase letters as different. For example, a search for "Apple" does not find the <string> "apple" or "APPLE", and the <expression> "APPLE" = "apple" <evaluate|evaluates> to false. 

If the <caseSensitive> is false, uppercase letters are treated as equal to their lowercase equivalents: a search for "Apple" finds strings such as "apple" or "APPLE" without paying attention to the case of each letter, and the expression  "APPLE" = "apple" <evaluate|evaluates> to true. 

The <caseSensitive> also affects <custom property> names and <array> <key> names. If the <caseSensitive> is true, <custom property> names that differ only in the case of their letters are treated as different <custom property|custom properties>. If the <caseSensitive> is false, <custom property> names that differ only in letter case cannot be distinguished from each other. The same is true for the <keys> of <array> <element|elements>. 

Since the <caseSensitive> is a local property, its <value> is <reset> to false when the current <handler> finishes <execute|executing>. It retains its <value> only for the current <handler>, and setting it in one <handler> does not affect its <value> in other <handler|handlers> it <call|calls>. 

>*Important:* <message|Messages>, <object> names, and <LiveCode> terms are never treated as case-sensitive, even if the <caseSensitive> is set to true.
