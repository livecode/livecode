Use to centerRect property to specifies a region of pixels that should be stretched when the image is stretched.

If empty, then the property has no effect. 

If the centerRect is set to a rectangle, then it is interpreted as relative to the source image rect (i.e. 0, 0, the formattedWidth of image, the formattedHeight of image) and it specifies a region of pixels that should be stretched when the image is stretched. In particular, the centerRect is stretched in both x and y directions, the corners outside of the centerRect are not stretched and the sides are stretched horizontally or vertically only depending on orientation.

The centerRect is useful for images being used as backgrounds to buttons as it allows a single image to be used to specify the borders and center stretching area.
