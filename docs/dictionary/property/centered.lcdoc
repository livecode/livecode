Name: centered

Type: property

Syntax: set the centered to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether <object|objects> are drawn from the center to the
edge, or from corner to corner.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the centered to true

Value (bool):
The <centered> is true or false.
By default, the <centered> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <centered> <property> to change the way <object|objects> are
drawn when they are created with the <object|object's> <tool>, and to
change how <object|objects> are resized.

If the <centered> <property> is set to true, when the user creates an
<object(glossary)> by clicking and dragging with the appropriate <tool>,
the first <point> clicked is the center of the <object(glossary)>, and
the user drags to an edge to complete the <object(glossary)>.

If the <centered> is false, the first <point> clicked is a corner, and
the user drags to the opposite corner to complete the
<object(glossary)>. 

The <centered> also affects how <object|objects> are resized with the
<Pointer tool>. If the <centered> is true, dragging a <handle> at the
corner or side of an <object(glossary)> resizes the <object(glossary)>
symmetrically, so its center remains in the same place. If the
<centered> is false, dragging a corner or side moves only that corner or
side.
