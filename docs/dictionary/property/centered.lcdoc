Name: centered

Type: property

Syntax: set the centered to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether <object|objects> are drawn from the center to the edge, or from corner to corner.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the centered to true

Value (bool):The <centered> is true or false.
By default, the <centered> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <centered> <property> to change the way <object|objects> are drawn when they are created with the <object|object's> <tool>, and to change how <object|objects> are resized.

If the <centered> <property> is set to true, when the user creates an <object> by clicking and dragging with the appropriate <tool>, the first <point> clicked is the center of the <object>, and the user drags to an edge to complete the <object>.

If the <centered> is false, the first <point> clicked is a corner, and the user drags to the opposite corner to complete the <object>.

The <centered> also affects how <object|objects> are resized with the <Pointer tool>. If the <centered> is true, dragging a <handle> at the corner or side of an <object> resizes the <object> symmetrically, so its center remains in the same place. If the <centered> is false, dragging a corner or side moves only that corner or side.
