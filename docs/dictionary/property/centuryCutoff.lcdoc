Description:
Use the <centuryCutoff> <property> to interpret dates close to the century mark.

The <centuryCutoff> specifies the two-digit year that ends the century. Two-digit years less than or equal to the <centuryCutoff> belong to the next century; two-digit years greater than the <centuryCutoff> belong to the previous century.

For example, if the <centuryCutoff> is set to 50, and the current year is 2000, then the date 4/12/51 is interpreted as being in the year 1951, while the date 4/12/50 is interpreted as being in 2050.
Since the <centuryCutoff> is a <local property>, its value is <reset> to 35 when the current <handler> finishes <execute|executing>. It retains its value only for the current <handler>, and setting it in one <handler> does not affect its value in other <handler|handlers> it <call|calls>.
