Name: charSet

Type: property

Syntax: get the charSet of <stack> 

Summary: Indicates whether the <Mac OS|Macintosh> or <ISO 8859> <character set> was used to enter a <stack|stack's> text.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
if the charSet of this stack is "MacOS" then put "Mac" into thePlatform

Value:
The <charSet> of a <stack> is "MacOS" or "ISO".
This property is read-only and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <charSet> <property> to determine which <platform> the <stack> was last saved on.

If the <charSet> is "MacOS", the <stack> was last saved on a <Mac OS|Mac OS system>; if the <charSet> is "ISO", the <stack> was last saved on a <Unix> or <Windows|Windows system>.

When you open a stack on a Mac OS system that was last saved on a Unix or Windows system (or vice versa), the text in the stack is translated automatically to the appropriate character set. The process can take a perceptible amount of time, so it's a good idea to save a stack destined for a particular platform on that platform before delivering it to users.

The <charSet> <property> is changed for all <stacks> in the same <stack file> when the <stack file> is saved, so it is not possible for two <stacks> in the same file to have a different <charSet>.
