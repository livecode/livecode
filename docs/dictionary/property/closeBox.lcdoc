Name: closeBox

Type: property

Syntax: set the closeBox of <stack> to {true | false}

Summary: Shows a window's <close box>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the closeBox of this stack to false

Value (bool): The <closeBox> <property> of a <stack> is true or false. By <default>, the <closeBox> of a newly created <stack> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <closeBox> property to display the close box in a window's title bar.

The setting of this property affects the <decorations> property, and vice versa. Setting a stack's <closeBox> property determines whether its <decorations> property includes "close" (or is "default", for window styles that normally include a close box). Conversely, setting a stack's <decorations> property sets its <closeBox> to true or false depending on whether the <decorations> includes "close" (or is "default").

>*Note:* On OS X systems, if the <closeBox> property is false, the close box is disabled rather than hidden.

Setting the <closeBox> <property> causes the <stack window> to flash briefly.

Changes:
The closeBox property was fully implemented in version 2.1. In previous versions, it was included in LiveCode for compatibility with imported SuperCard projects, but setting it had no effect.
