Name: colorMap

Type: property

Syntax: set the colorMap to <colorsList>

Summary:
Lists the colors in the current <color table>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
set the colorMap to myMap

Example:
if the colorMap is fixed then usePhotoIcons

Value:
The <colorMap> is a list of <color reference|color references>, one per
line. A color reference is any standard color name; or three
comma-separated integers between zero and 255, specifying the level of
each of red, green, and blue; or an HTML-style color consisting of a
hash mark (#) followed by three hexadecimal numbers, one for each of
red, green, and blue.

The <colorMap> <property> contains the number of lines <return|returned>
by the <screenColors> <function>.

Description:
Use the <colorMap> <property> to specify what colors LiveCode uses to
draw its windows when the <bit depth> of the screen is 8 <bit|bits> or
less. 

If the bit depth is greater than 8 bits, the <colorMap> <property>
always reports "fixed".

The number of lines in the <colorMap> <property> is set when the
<application> starts up, and does not change if you change color depths
while running the <application>.

If you leave a line blank when setting the <colorMap>, the color
corresponding to that <line> is left unchanged.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Windows|Windows systems>, colors 110 and
> 246256 cannot be changed.

On Unix systems, setting the <colorMap> <property> sets the
<privateColors> <property> to true.
