Value:
The <colors> of an <object(glossary)> is a list of <color
reference|color references>, one per line. A color reference is any
standard color name; or three comma-separated integers between zero and
255, specifying the level of each of red, green, and blue; or an
HTML-style color consisting of a hash mark (#) followed by three
hexadecimal numbers, one for each of red, green, and blue.

The <colors> of an <image(glossary)> contains as many lines as there are
colors used in the <image(glossary)>. The <colors> of all other
<object(glossary)|objects> consists of eight lines, some of which may be
empty. 

Description:
Use the <colors> <property> to get all eight basic color <properties> at
once, or to set the colors of one <object(glossary)> to be the same as
the colors of another <object(glossary)>.

For <object(glossary)|objects> other than <image(glossary)|images>, you
can set all these colors individually; the <colors> <property> simply
provides a shorter method of dealing with all of them at once. Each
<line> of the <colors> corresponds to one of the following color
<properties> :

* Line 1: the <foregroundColor>
* Line 2: the <backgroundColor>
* Line 3: the <hiliteColor>
* Line 4: the <borderColor>
* Line 5: the <topColor> 
* Line 6: the <bottomColor>
* Line 7: the <shadowColor>
* Line 8: the <focusColor>


If you leave a line blank when setting the <colors>, the color
<property> corresponding to that <line> is left unchanged.

If the <colors> <property> of an <object(glossary)> reports a blank
line, that color is not set for the individual <object(glossary)>, but
is <inheritance|inherited> from the <object(glossary)|object's> <owner>.
Use the form the effective colors of <object(glossary)> to obtain the
colors used for the object, whether set for the <object(glossary)> or
<inheritance|inherited>. 

If a pattern is set for an <object(glossary)>, that pattern is used
instead of the corresponding color for that <object(glossary)>.
