By default, the <columnDelimiter> is set to <tab>.

Description:
Use the <columnDelimiter> property in conjunction with the <split command> to divide text into an array of columns or with the <combine command> to combine an array of columns into a string.

From LiveCode 7.0, <columnDelimiter> can be a string of one or several <character|characters>.

Since the <columnDelimiter> is a local property, its value is reset to <tab> when the current handler finishes executing. It retains its value only for the current handler and setting it in one handler does not affect its value in other handlers called.
