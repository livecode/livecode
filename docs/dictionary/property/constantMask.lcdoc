Name: constantMask

Type: property

Syntax: set the constantMask of <image> to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether <animated GIF|animated GIFs> ignore changes in the
<mask> data when displaying the <GIF>.

Associations: image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the constantMask of image "Demo" to true

Value (bool):
The <constantMask> of an <image(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <constantMask> <property> of newly created
<image(object)|images> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <constantMask> <property> to enable display of certain <animated
GIF> <image(object)|images>.

Some animated GIF images use an optimization technique in which the mask
data is used to hold information about differences between successive
frames. When played, these GIFs can have display problems because the
mask data is being used in a non-standard way. Set the <constantMask> to
true to correct the problem with these <GIF|GIFs>.

Setting the <constantMask> to true may have some undesirable side
effects--the <image(object)|image's> appearance may be incorrect if you
move it while the animation is playing, or if there is an
<object(glossary)> underneath it--so use this <property> only when
necessary. 

>*Note:* If the <constantMask> is set to true, clicking a transparent
> portion of a <frame> may unexpectedly send <message|messages> such as
> <mouseUp> to the <image(keyword)>, instead of the <object(glossary)>
> underneath the <image(keyword)>. This is because when deciding whether
> the user has clicked a transparent <pixel>, LiveCode uses the
> <mask|masks> for all the <frame|frames>, rather than for the current
> <frame>, if the <constantMask> is true.

>*Important:*  Setting an <image(object)|image's> <constantMask>
> <property> to true can cause problems with the <image(object)|image's>
> appearance if you move it under <script> control while the animation
> is playing, or if there's an <object(glossary)> underneath it. Avoid
> setting the <constantMask> <property> to true unless necessary.
