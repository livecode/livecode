Name: constraints

Type: property

Syntax: get the constraints of <player>

Summary:
Limits the <pan>, <tilt>, and <zoom> in a <QuickTime VR> movie.

Associations: player

Introduced: 1.0

Deprecated: 8.1

OS: mac, windows, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
get the constraints of player "Arctic"

Example:
set the pan of me to item 2 of line 1 of the constraints of me

Value (enum):
The <constraints> is a list consisting of three lines:

        - The minimum and maximum <pan>, separated by commas.
        - The minimum and maximum <tilt>, separated by commas.
        - The minimum and maximum <zoom>, separated by commas.

Each value is a number.
This property is read:only and cannot be set


Description:
Use the <constraints> <property> to find out where the user is in a
<QuickTime VR> movie.

The user can move the view of a QuickTime VR movie using the
navigational controls in the player; a handler can change the view by
setting the player's <pan> and <tilt> <properties>, and change the view
angle by changing the <zoom> <property>.

The <zoom>, <pan>, and <tilt> are limited by the <value> of the
<player|player's> <constraints> <property>. If you specify a <value>
greater than the <range> permitted by the <constraints>, the <property>
is set to the highest permitted <value>. If you specify a <value> less
than the <range> permitted by the <constraints>, the <property> is set
to the lowest permitted <value>.

If the player does not contain a QuickTime VR movie, its <constraints>
<property> is empty.

Changes:
This property was deprecated in version 8.1.0 due to the retirement of
the QuickTime player implementation. In order to support 64-bit on Mac 
we have been required to switch to using AVFoundation on Mac, which does 
not support QTVR. In addition, the Windows player object is now based on 
DirectShow, as Apple have dropped support for the QuickTime libraries 
previously used.
