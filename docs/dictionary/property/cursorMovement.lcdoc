Description:
Use the <cursorMovement> property to set the mechanism that is to be
used for moving the cursor in a field.

The <cursorMovement> property sets the mechanism that is to be used for
moving the cursor in fields containing both left-to-right and
right-to-left text.

The "visual" cursor movement mechanism moves the cursor in visual order,
i.e pressing left will always move the cursor one position to the left.
This is the default cursor movement on OS X.

The "logical" cursor movement moves the cursor to the next character in
logical (reading) order when the left arrow is pressed and to the
previous logical character when the right arrow is pressed. This is the
default cursor movement on Windows.

Setting the <cursorMovement> property to empty indicates that the engine
should use the default behaviour for the platform that it is being run
on.
