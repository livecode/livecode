Name: customKeys

Synonyms: userproperties

Type: property

Syntax: set the customKeys of <object> to {<propertiesList> | empty}

Summary:
Lists the names of all the <custom property|custom properties> of an
<object(glossary)>. 

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

set the customKeys of stack "Preferences" to empty

Value:
The <customKeys> of an <object(glossary)> is a list of that
<object|object's> <custom property> names, one per <line>.

Description:
Use the <customKeys> <property> to find out what <custom property|custom
properties> an <object(glossary)> has, and to create or delete 
<custom property|custom properties>.

The <customKeys> lists the names of <property|properties> in the
<object|object's> current <customPropertySet>. If the <object(glossary)>
has more than one <custom property set>, you must switch to the desired
property set before checking the <customKeys>. The following example
displays the <custom property|custom properties> in a 
<custom property set> called "Francois" :

    set the customPropertySet of button "My Button" to "Francois"
    answer the customKeys of button "My Button" -- in "Francois" set


Alternatively, the custom property set can be accessed using:

    answer the customKeys["Francois"] of button "My Button"


If you set the <customKeys> of an <object(glossary)>, and the
<propertiesList> contains a <custom property> that the
<object(glossary)> doesn't have, a <custom property> with that name is
created. (A property name can be up to 255 characters long. The number
of property names is limited only by LiveCode's total memory space.) The
value of a newly-created custom property is empty.

If you set the <customKeys> of an <object(glossary)> and do not include
the name of an existing <custom property>, that <custom property> is
deleted. Setting the <customKeys> to empty deletes all 
<custom property|custom properties> in the current custom property set.
