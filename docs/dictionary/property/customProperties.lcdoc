Specifies all the <custom property|custom properties> of an
<object(glossary)> that are in the current <customPropertySet>, along
with their settings.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the customProperties of this card to myPropertiesArray

Example:
put the customProperties["mySet"] of me into myArray

Value:
The <customProperties> of an <object(glossary)> is an <array> of <custom
property|custom properties> and their <value|values>. The name of each
<custom property> is the <array> <key>.

Description:
Use the <customProperties> <property> to set or retrieve all the <custom
property|custom properties> of an <object(glossary)> at once.

The <customProperties> specifies the <property|properties> in the
<object|object's> current <customPropertySet>. (The <object(glossary)>
can have other <custom property|custom properties>, which are accessed
by switching to another <customPropertySet>.)

You can get or change the value of a single custom property using array
notation. For example, the following statement copies the entire set of
custom properties from one card to another, changing only the custom
property named "changedDate" :

    put the customProperties of this card into myCustomProps
    put field 3 into myCustomProps["changedDate"]
    set the customProperties of next card to myCustomProps


>*Note:* You can also set <custom property|custom properties>
> individually using the <set> <command>.

To refer to a custom property set that is not the current
<customPropertySet>, use <array> notation. For example, to get an
<array> consisting of all the <custom property|custom properties> in a
<custom property set> called "MyProps", use a <statement> like the
following: 

    get the customProperties["MyProps"] of this card
