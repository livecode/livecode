Name: dashes

Type: property

Syntax: set the dashes [of <graphic>] to <pixelsOn> [, <pixelsOff>]

Summary: Specifies the appearance of dashed lines in <graphic|graphics> and paint <image|images>.

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the dashes to 10,2 -- 10-pixel dashes separated by 2 pixels

Example:
set the dashes of graphic "Connector" to 1,2,5,2 -- "dit-dah" dashes

Example:
set the dashes of graphic 10 to empty -- makes a solid line

Value:
A list of numbers which specifies a sequence of pixel lengths that alternately represent space and dash lengths. 
By default, the <dashes> <property> of a newly created <graphic> is set to empty.

Description:
Use the <dashes> <property> to change the <appearance> of lines.

The odd-numbered items in the <dashes> <property> represent the number of <pixel|pixels> in a dash, and the even-numbered <items> 
represent the number of <pixel|pixels> in the blank space after the dash. The list is repeated for the length of the line.  
An odd number of <pixel> lengths will cause the dash and space <pixel> lengths to alternate between repeats. 
For example, if the <dashes> is set to 20,10,5 the line will contain the following: 20 pixel dash, 10 pixel space, 
5 pixel dash, 20 pixel space, 10 pixel dash, 5 pixel space etc.

If the <dashes> <property> contains a single <integer> the dashes and spaces will both be given this pixel value. 
If the dashes property is empty, the line will be solid.

The global setting of the <dashes> <property> <control|controls> the <appearance> of lines drawn with the 
<paint tool|paint tools> in the same way. Once a paint line is drawn however, its <appearance> cannot be changed by 
changing the <global> <dashes> <property>.

>*Note:* The <capStyle> <property> of a <graphic> is set to "round" by <default>. The <roundEnds> <property> of a graphic is <true> 
by <default>. Under these conditions, a <dashes> length that is equal to or less than the <lineSize> <property> of the <graphic> will 
make the line appear solid. To ensure that the line appears with dashes do one or more of the following:
* <set> the odd-numbered items (the dash length) or the even-numbered items (the blank space length) 
of the <dashes> <property> to a value greater than the <lineSize>;
* <set> the <roundEnds> of the <graphic> to <false>;
* <set> the <capStyle> property of the <graphic> to "butt".
