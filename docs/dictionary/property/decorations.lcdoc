Name: decorations

Type: property

Syntax: set the decorations of <stack> to {<controlList> | <WDEF> | default | empty}

Summary:
Specifies the window controls and appearance of a <stack window>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
set the decorations of this stack to "title,minimize"

Example:
set the decorations of stack "Splash Screen" to empty

Example:
set the decorations of stack myStack to 127 -- a WDEF resource

The result:
>*Important:*  The <decorations> are set all at once, and if you don't
> include a decoration, it is removed from the stack window. For
> example, if you set the decorations to "metal", the resulting window
> won't include a title bar, even if it had one initially. To set a
> stack to metal appearance while showing a title bar with close,
> minimize, and maximize box, you need to set all the decorations at
> once. 

Value:
The <decorations> of a <stack> is one of the following:

- "default"
- empty
- one or more of "title", "minimize", "maximize", "close", "menu",
  "system", "noShadow", and "metal", separated by commas
- a WDEF identifier (on Mac OS or OS X systems)


By default, the <decorations> <property> of newly created <stacks> is
set to "default"

Description:
Use the <decorations> <property> to change the appearance of windows.

You can specify one or more of the following decorations:
* title: Shows the window's title bar
* minimize: Shows the minimize (iconify) box in the title bar
* maximize: Shows the maximize (zoom) box in the title bar
* close: Shows the close box in the title bar
* menu: Shows the menu bar in the window (<Unix> and <Windows>
  only) 
* system: Shows the window as a system window (OS X, Unix, and
  Windows only)
* noShadow: Remove the window's drop shadow (OS X only)
* metal: Shows the window with a textured appearance (OS X only)


>*Note:* The "metal" and "system" options are not compatible. If you set
> a <stack|stack's> <decorations> to a <string> that includes both, its
> window becomes a non- <metal> <system window>.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, the "system" option
> has no effect.

Setting a stack's <decorations> to empty removes the entire <title bar>,
along with the window borders.

Setting a stack's <decorations> to "default" gives it appropriate
decorations for its <style>. If the <style> is "topLevel", the window
includes all the decorations (<title bar>, <menu bar> [on <Unix> and
<Windows|Windows systems>], <close box>, <minimize> box, <maximize> box)
by <default>. Otherwise, the window includes a <title bar> by <default>.

The <decorations> <property> interacts with the <closeBox>,
<minimizeBox>, <metal>, <shadow>, <systemWindow>, and <zoomBox>
<properties>. Setting any of these <properties> to true changes the
<decorations> <property> to include the corresponding option, and
including any of the "close", "minimize", "metal", "noShadow", "system",
and "maximize" options in a <stack|stack's> <decorations> sets the
corresponding <property> to true.

    set the decorations of stack "Test" to \
        "metal,title,close,minimize,maximize"


This applies only to the <decorations> property. If you use the
individual properties (such as <metal> and <closeBox>) instead, you
don't need to reset the other decorations-related properties.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On Mac OS and OS X systems, the "menu"
> decoration has no effect. On Windows systems, the "menu" decoration
> must be set along with the "maximize" or "minimize" decorations: you
> cannot use "maximize" or "minimize" without including "menu". On OS X
> systems, the minimize, close, and zoom boxes are always visible if the
> title bar is, and turning off these options disables the boxes instead
> of removing them, in comformance with user-interface guidelines for
> this platform.

A WDEF identifier is the number of a Mac OS WDEF resource multiplied by
16, plus a variation code between zero and 15. For example, if you have
a WDEF resource whose ID is 124, and you want to use its 14th variation
(which is number 13, since the numbers start with zero), set the stack's
<decorations> <property> to 1997. This number is 124 (the resource ID)
times 16, plus 13 (the variation code). Various <WDEF> resources are
included in the operating system--the exact <WDEF|WDEFs> available vary
from version to version. <WDEF> routines, like <externals>, can be
written in a programming language and compiled.

>*Cross-platform note:*  <WDEF|WDEF resources> can be used only on <Mac
> OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>. For a <cross-platform> method of changing
> a window's shape, use the <windowShape> <property>.

Changes:
The "close", "system", "noShadow", and "metal" options were introduced
in version 2.1.
