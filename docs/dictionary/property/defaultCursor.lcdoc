Name: defaultCursor

Type: property

Syntax: set the defaultCursor to <imageID> 

Summary: Specifies the <default> shape of the <cursor>.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the defaultCursor to arrow

Value:
The <defaultCursor> is the <ID> of an <image> to use for a <cursor(property)>. 
LiveCode looks for the specified image in the following order:

1) The stack of the current object's <behavior> (if applicable)
2) The stack of the owner of the current object's <behavior> (if applicable)
 ...
n) The stack of the current object's stack's <behavior> (if applicable)
A) The current object's stack
B) The current object's stack's mainstack (if a substack)
C) The current object's stack's mainstacks substacks
D) The list of open stacks, in order they were loaded

Description:
Use the <defaultCursor> <property> to change the <cursor(property)> used when the <Browse tool> is being used from a hand to some other <cursor(property)> shape.

>*Tip:*  LiveCode includes several built-in <cursor(glossary)|cursors> whose names you can use in place of their image IDs. The built-in cursors are described in the entry for the <cursor(property)> <property>.

If the <lockCursor> <property> is set to false, the <cursor(property)> changes shape automatically as the mouse moves. (For example, the <cursor(property)> normally turns into an arrow over a <menu>, an I-beam over an editable <field>, and so on.) The <defaultCursor> is the shape used automatically when the <mouse pointer> is in a stack window, but not in an editable <field>.

Changes:
The order in which LiveCode searches for cursors was changed in version 3.5. Previously, the current stack was searched first, followed by the list of open stacks.
