Name: defaultCursor

Type: property

Syntax: set the defaultCursor to <imageID>

Summary:
Specifies the <default> shape of the <cursor>.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the defaultCursor to arrow

Value:
The <defaultCursor> is the <ID> of an <image> to use for a
<cursor(property)>. LiveCode looks for the specified image in the
following order:

1. The stack of the current object's <behavior> (if applicable)
2. The stack of the owner of the current object's <behavior> (if
applicable)
3. The stack of the current object's stack's <behavior> (if applicable)
4. The current object's stack
5. The current object's stack's mainstack (if a substack)
6. The current object's stack's mainstacks substacks
7. The list of open stacks, in order they were loaded

Description:
Use the <defaultCursor> <property> to change the <cursor(property)> used
when the <Browse tool> is being used from a hand to some other
<cursor(property)> shape.

>*Tip:*  LiveCode includes several built-in <cursor(glossary)|cursors>
> whose names you can use in place of their image IDs. The built-in
> cursors are described in the entry for the <cursor(property)>
> <property>. 

If the <lockCursor> <property> is set to false, the <cursor(property)>
changes shape automatically as the mouse moves. (For example, the
<cursor(property)> normally turns into an arrow over a <menu>, an I-beam
over an editable <field>, and so on.) The <defaultCursor> is the shape
used automatically when the <mouse pointer> is in a stack window, but
not in an editable <field>.

Changes:
The order in which LiveCode searches for cursors was changed in version
3.5. Previously, the current stack was searched first, followed by the
list of open stacks.
