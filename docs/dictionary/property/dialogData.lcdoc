Summary: Specifies data to be <pass|passed> to a <dialog box>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Value: The <dialogData> is a <string>.

Description:
Use the <dialogData> <property> to <pass> data between a <dialog box> and the <stack> that opens the <dialog box>.

The <dialogData> can be used for any data you wish to place in it. For example, you can use it within a <modal dialog box|modal dialog> <stack> to hold the name of the <button> the user clicked, the state of other options that are set in the <dialog box>, the contents of text <field|fields> the user filled in, and any other information. The <handler> that showed the <dialog box> can then use the information in the <dialogData>. The <caller|calling handler> can also place information--for example, <default> settings--into the <dialogData> <property>, and the <modal dialog box|modal dialog> <stack> can use that information to set up the <dialog box> when it opens.

Since the <dialogData> <property> is <global> and can be set or accessed by any <stack>, this method generally creates simpler code than the alternatives (such as using <global> <variable|variables>, or <pass|passing> <parameter|parameters> between <stacks>).

>*Tip:*  The built-in "Answer Dialog" and "Ask Dialog" stacks, which are used by the <ask> and <answer> <command|commands>, use the <dialogData> <property> to <pass> data between the <development environment> and the <dialog box>. To see the <script|scripts> used for these <stacks>, enter one of the following <statement|statements> into the <message box>:

    edit the script of card 1 of stack "Answer Dialog"
    edit the script of card 1 of stack "Ask Dialog"
