Name: disabled

Type: property

Syntax: set the disabled of <object> to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies that an <object(glossary)> is dimmed and does not respond to
user action.

Associations: field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player, image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the disabled of button "Destroy Everything" to true

Example:
set the disabled of menu "View" to true

Value (bool):
The <disabled> of a <control(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <disabled> <property> of newly created
<control(object)|controls> is false.

Description:
Use the <disabled> <property> to find out whether a <control> can
respond to mouse clicks or keyboard presses.

Disabled buttons are drawn with gray borders and text to indicate that
they cannot be clicked. Controls whose <disabled> <property> is true do
not <trigger> <message|messages> such as <mouseUp> or <mouseEnter>, but
they can respond to <message|messages> sent with the <send> <command>.
If a disabled <control> is on top of an enabled <control>, the disabled
<control> is transparent to clicks, and clicking sends the appropriate
<message|messages> to the enabled <control> underneath.

A disabled control cannot receive the focus.

Setting a group's <disabled> <property> sets the <disabled> of each
<control> in the <group>.

You can set the <disabled> <property> of a <menu(keyword)> by specifying
the <menu(glossary)|menu's> name or number. <menu item|Menu items> in
disabled <menus> are drawn in gray text and cannot be chosen.

The <disabled> <property> of an <object(glossary)> is the logical
inverse of that <object|object's> <enabled> <property>. When the
<enabled> is true, the disabled is false, and vice versa.
