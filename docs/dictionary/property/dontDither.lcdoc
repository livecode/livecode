Name: dontDither

Type: property

Syntax: set the dontDither of <image> to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether 24-bit <image|images> are <dither|dithered> on displays with fewer colors.

Associations: image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the dontDither of image "Photo" to false

Example:
set the dontDither of image "Line Art" to true

Value (bool):The <dontDither> of an <image(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <dontDither> <property> of newly created <image(object)|images> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <dontDither> <property> to control how <bitmap|bitmapped> <image(object)|images> such as <JPEG|JPEGs> or <PNG|PNGs> behave when the <stack> is used on a display whose <bit depth> is 8 <bit|bits> (256 colors) or fewer.

If the <dontDither> of an <image(keyword)> is set to true, then when that <image(keyword)> is displayed on an 8- <bit> screen, colors that are not part of the current <color table> are displayed as a solid block of the closest available color. This may create visible banding on <image(object)|images> with continuous gradations of color.

If the <dontDither> of an <image(keyword)> is false, colors that are not part of the current <color table> are displayed as a <dither|dithered> pattern made up of two or more close colors, in order to approximate the exact color. This is preferable for <image(object)|images> such as photographs that include continuous gradations of color, but may produce speckling on <image(object)|images> with large blocks of solid color.

The setting of the <dontDither> <property> has no effect on 24-bit or 16-bit screens.
