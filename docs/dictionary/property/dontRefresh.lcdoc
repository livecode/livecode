Name: dontRefresh

Type: property

Syntax: set the dontRefresh of <videoClip> to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether the last <frame> of a <video clip> remains visible or is cleared at the end of the movie.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the dontRefresh of videoclip "Sample Movie" to true

Value (bool):The <dontRefresh> of a <video clip> is true or false.
By default, the <dontRefresh> <property> of newly created <video clip|video clips> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <dontRefresh> <property> to leave the final <frame> of a movie visible.

If a video clip's <dontRefresh> <property> is true, the last <frame> of the movie remains on the screen after the movie is finished playing, until that portion of the screen is <redraw|redrawn>.

If the <dontRefresh> is false, the last <frame> disappears at the end of the movie.

>*Note:* The <color table> used by the movie does not persist after the movie finishes playing. This means that if the <screenColors> is 256 or fewer, the colors in the last frame may shift when the movie ends. To prevent this problem, you can set the <colorMap> <property> to the set of colors used by the movie.
