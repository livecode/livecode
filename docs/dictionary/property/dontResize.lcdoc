Type: property

Syntax: set the dontResize of <graphic> to {true | false}

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Example:
set the dontResize of graphic 12 to true

Value (bool):The <dontResize> of a <graphic(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <dontResize> <property> of newly created <graphic(object)|graphics> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <dontResize> <property> to automatically resize and reposition a <graphic(keyword)> when you set its <points> <property>.

You can reshape a graphic whose <style> <property> is set to polygon by changing its <points> or <relativePoints> <property>.

If you change the graphic's <points> or <relativePoints> <property>, and the <graphic(object)|graphic's> <dontResize> <property> is set to false, the <graphic(keyword)> is resized and repositioned if necessary to accommodate the new shape.

If you change the <points> or <relativePoints> and the <dontResize> is false, the <graphic(keyword)> is not resized to fit the new set of <vertex|vertexes>. This may result in parts of the shape being cut off at the boundaries of the <graphic(keyword)>.
