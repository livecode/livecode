Name: dragSpeed

Type: property

Syntax: set the dragSpeed to <pixelsPerSecond> 

Summary: Specifies the speed of the <drag> <command>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the dragSpeed to 10

Value:
The <dragSpeed> is an <integer> between zero and 65535.
By default, the <dragSpeed> <property> is set to zero.  It is <reset> to zero when no <handler|handlers> are <execute|executing>.

Description:
Use the <dragSpeed> <property> to control the speed of the <drag> <command>.

The <dragSpeed> specifies how many <pixels> per second the <drag> <command> moves.

The setting of the <dragSpeed> affects the smoothness of drags made with some of the <paint tool|paint tools> (such as the Spray Can <tool>) whose action is speed-dependent.

If the <dragSpeed> is zero, the <drag> <command> moves as fast as possible. Dragging with the <dragSpeed> set to zero is equivalent to clicking the start location and immediately releasing the <mouse button> at the end location. This means you cannot <drag> shapes other than a straight line if the <dragSpeed> is zero.
