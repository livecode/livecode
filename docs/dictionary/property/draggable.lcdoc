Description:
The <draggable> <property> is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with imported <SuperCard> projects.

In SuperCard, the <draggable> <property> determines whether a window can be dragged by its <title bar>.

In LiveCode, setting this property sets the stack's <decorations> <property> to "title". Setting the <stack|stack's> <draggable> back to false does not change the <stack|stack's> decorations.

Setting the <draggable> <property> causes the <stack window> to flash briefly.
