Description:
Use the <dropShadow> property to create a shadow effect on an object.
If the object is opaque,  the shadow effect is applied to the exterior 
boundary of the object. If the object is transparent, the shadow is 
applied to the interior visible elements of the control: the text 
in the field, the label/name of the button (if shown) or the lines of the graphic.
The <dropShadow> is an array style property, each key of the array
controls a different <dropShadow> parameter that will affect its final
appearance. The easiest way to adjust these properties is by using the
Graphic Effects card of the property inspector which has full control
over each parameter. To control the effect by script use the following
properties: 

dropShadow["color"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the shadow, in the format
red,green,blue where each value is between 0 and 255.

dropShadow["blendMode"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the shadow is blended with objects
behind it. This is one of the following values:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "normal" :
the shadow is laid over the background.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "multiply"
: this results in a darkening effect

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-
"colorDodge" : this results in a lightening effect

dropShadow["opacity"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How opaque the shadow is. The value is
between 0 (fully transparent) and 255 (fully opaque).

dropShadow["filter"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which algorithm is used to render the
shadow. This is one of the following options:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"gaussian" :
highest quality (and slowest)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"box3pass" :
high quality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"box2pass" :
medium quality

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"box1pass" :
low quality (and fastest)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the "colorDodge" blend mode, it
is recommended that you set the filter mode to "gaussian".

dropShadow["size"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the shadow, i.e. how large the
shadow is. This is between 0 and 255.

dropShadow["spread"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This controls where the effect begins to
blend. This is between 0 and 255.

dropShadow["distance"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This controls how far the shadow is offset
from the object. This is between 0 and 359.

dropShadow["angle"]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controls the direction the shadow is
cast in. This is between 0 and 360.
