Value:
The <endTime> of a <player(keyword)> is an <integer> between zero and the <player(object)|player's> <duration>.
By default, the <endTime> <property> of newly created <player(object)|players> is set to empty.

Description:
Use the <endTime> <property> to set or get the <selection> in a <player(keyword)>.

If the playSelection <property> is true, only the <selected> portion plays, so you can use the <startTime> and <endTime> <properties> of the <player(keyword)> to play whatever portion of the sound or movie you want.

The <endTime> is the number of the interval where the <selection> ends. (The number of intervals per second is specified by the player's <timeScale> <property>. The total number of intervals is given in the <player(object)|player's> <duration> property.) If there is no <selection>, the <endTime> is empty.
