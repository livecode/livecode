Type: property

Summary: Specifies the key used to create special (extended <ASCII>) characters on <Unix|Unix systems>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the extendKey to 6 -- disables entry of high-bit chars

Value:
The <extendKey> is a positive <integer>.
By default, the <extendKey> is set to 5, so the <modifier key> is the mod5 key specified by the "xmodmap" program on your computer.

Description:
Use the <extendKey> <property> to specify how to create special characters, or to prevent users from typing special characters.

The <extendKey> specifies the <modifier key> used to toggle the high <bit> of <characters> on and off. Use the "xmodmap" program to find out which key is used for mod5 (or the <modifier key> specified for the <extendKey>).

To enter a high-bit character, press the modifier key, then type the key that corresponds to that character, then press the modifier key again to return to entering regular ASCII characters.

If the <extendKey> is greater than 5, entry of high-bit <characters> is disabled.

The setting of this property has no effect on Mac OS and Windows systems.
