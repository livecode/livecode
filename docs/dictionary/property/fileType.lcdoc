Name: fileType

Type: property

Syntax: set the fileType to <creator> & <type>

Summary:
Specifies the <creator signature|creator> and <type signature|file type>
for any non- <stack> <files> a <handler> creates on a <Mac OS> or <OS
X|OS X system>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, ios

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the fileType to "ttxtTEXT" -- text file owned by SimpleText app

Value:
The <fileType> is an eight- <character> <string>. The first four
<characters> are the <creator signature>, and the last four are the
<type signature|file type>.

Description:
Use the <fileType> <property> to ensure that <files> that a <standalone
application> creates are recognized by the operating system as belonging
to the <standalone application|standalone>.

>*Important:*  The <type signature|file type> and <creator signature>
> are <case-sensitive>.

When a file is saved on a Mac OS or OS X system, a 4-character file type
and 4-character creator signature are saved with it. The creator
signature specifies which application owns the file. The application
determines the file format from the file type; the type is also used to
determine which applications (other than the owner) can work with the
file. 

The <fileType> <property> is used to set the <type signature|file type>
and <creator signature|creator> of <files> created by the <open file>
<command> and of <files> created putting data into a <file>, <binfile>,
or <resfile> <URL> that doesn't yet exist. (To specify the <type
signature|file type> and <creator signature|creator> for <stack
file|stack files> your application creates with the <save> <command>,
use the <stackFileType> <property> instead.)

This property has no effect on Unix and Windows systems.

>*Important:*  To avoid conflicts with other applications, register any
> new <creator signature|creator signatures> with Apple Computer if you
> plan to distribute a <stack> or <standalone application> that uses
> this property. Apple maintains a registry of <creator
> signature|creator signatures> on its web site at
> http://developer.apple.com/dev/cftype/.
