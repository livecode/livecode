Name: filled

Type: property

Syntax: set the filled [of <graphic>] to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether <graphic|graphics> and shapes drawn with the <paint tool|paint tools> are filled or hollow.

Synonyms: showFill

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the filled to true -- affects paint tools

Example:
set the filled of graphic "Square" to false

Value (bool):The <filled> of a <graphic(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <filled> of newly created <graphic(object)|graphics> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <filled> <property> to change the appearance of graphics

If the <filled> <property> is set to true, the interior of shapes is filled with the <brushColor> (or <brushPattern>, if one is set). If the <graphic(object)|graphic's> <style> <property> is "line", the <filled> <property> has no effect.

The global setting of the <filled> <property> controls the appearance of shapes drawn with the <paint tool|paint tools>. Once a paint shape is drawn, its <appearance> cannot be changed by changing the <global> <filled> <property>.

>*Tip:*  Clicking the interior of a <graphic(keyword)> whose <filled> is set to false does not send mouse <message|messages> to the <graphic(keyword)> unless the <graphic(keyword)> is already <selected>. To create a <graphic(keyword)> whose interior is transparent, but clickable, set the <graphic(object)|graphic's> <filled> <property> to true and its <ink> <property> to noOp<a/>.

>*Note:* When applied to graphics, the <filled> property behaves as a synonym for the <opaque> property.
