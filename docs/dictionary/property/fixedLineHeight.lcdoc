Example:
set the fixedLineHeight of the selectedField to false

Value (bool):The <fixedLineHeight> of a <field(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <fixedLineHeight> <property> of newly created <field(object)|fields> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <fixedLineHeight> <property> to control the appearance of <field(object)|fields> with multiple <font|fonts>, sizes, or styles.

If a field's <fixedLineHeight> <property> is set to true, the height allotted for each line in the <field(keyword)> is equal to the <field(object)|field's> <textHeight>. This means that if some of the text in the <field(keyword)> is taller than the <field(object)|field's> <textHeight>, it may be truncated.

If the <fixedLineHeight> is false, the height of each line depends on the size of the text in that line.
