Value:
The <focusColor> of an <object> is any valid <color reference>.
The <colorName> is any standard color name.

The <RGBColor> consists of three comma-separated <integer|integers> between zero and 255, specifying the level of each of red, green, and blue; or an HTML-style color consisting of a hash mark (#) followed by three <hexadecimal> numbers, one for each of red, green, and blue.

By default, the <focusColor> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Use the <focusColor> <property> to specify the outline color of an <object> when it's active.

Setting the <focusColor> of an <object> to empty allows the <focusColor> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show through. Use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what color is used for the <object>, even if its own <focusColor> is empty.

If the <focusColor> is not set for any <object> in the <object hierarchy>, the system setting is used.

The setting of the <focusColor> <property> has different effects, depending on the <object type>:

* The <focusColor> of a <stack>, <card>, or <group> determines the <focusColor> of each <object> in the <stack>, <card>, or <group> that does not have its own <focusColor>.

* The <focusColor> of a <button(keyword)> is used to outline the <button(keyword)> when it is <focus|focused>. If the <button(object)|button's> <style> is menu, or if the button's traversalOn <property> is false, the <focusColor> has no effect.

* The <focusColor> of a <field> or <scrollbar> is used to outline the <object> when it is <focus|focused>. If the <object|object's> <traversalOn> <property> is false, the <focusColor> has no effect.

* The <focusColor> of a <graphic>, <player>, <audioClip>, <videoClip>, or <EPS|EPS object> has no effect.

* The <focusColor> of an <image> is the eighth color in the image's <color palette>.

If an object's focusPattern is set, the pattern is shown instead of the color specified by the <focusColor>.

The <focusColor> <property> has no effect on <control|controls> whose <showFocusBorder> <property> is set to false.

If the lookAndFeel is set to "Macintosh" or "Appearance Manager", the <focusColor> affects only fields.
