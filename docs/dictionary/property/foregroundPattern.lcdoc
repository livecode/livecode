Name: foregroundPattern

Synonyms: forepattern, textpattern, thumbpattern

Type: property

Syntax: set the foregroundPattern of <object> to {<patternNumber> | <imageID> | empty}

Syntax: set the foregroundPattern of [<chunk> of] <field> to {<patternNumber> | <imageID> | empty}

Summary:
Specifies the pattern used for <object(glossary)> text and borders.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the foregroundPattern of me to 1034

Example:
set the textPattern of line 2 of field "Cards" to 111

Value:
The <foregroundPattern> of an <object(glossary)> is a pattern specifier.
A <patternNumber> is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164. These
patterns are provided for compatibility with patterns available in
MetaCard and correspond to LiveCode's built in image id 137 to 300. As
with MetaCard pattern numbers 105 to 114 and 146 and above are 
unavailable.

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode
looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in
other open <stacks>.

By default, the <foregroundPattern> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Use the <foregroundPattern> <property> to change the pattern used for
text or the pattern that fills an <object(glossary)>.

Pattern images can be color or black-and-white.

>*Cross-platform note:*  To be used as a pattern on <Mac OS|Mac OS
> systems>, an <image> must be 128x128 <pixels> or less, and both its
> <height> and <width> must be a power of 2. To be used on <Windows> and
> <Unix|Unix systems>, <height> and <width> must be divisible by 8. To
> be used as a fully cross-platform pattern, both an image's dimensions
> should be one of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.

The <foregroundPattern> of <control(object)|controls> is drawn starting
at the <control(object)|control's> upper right corner: if the
<control(keyword)> is moved, the pattern does not shift.

Setting the <foregroundPattern> of an <object(glossary)> to empty allows
the <foregroundPattern> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show
through. Use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what pattern is used
for the <object(glossary)>, even if its own <foregroundPattern> is
empty. 

The setting of the <foregroundPattern> <property> has different effects,
depending on the <object type>:

* The <foregroundPattern> of a <stack>, <card>, or <group> determines
  the <foregroundPattern> of each <object(glossary)> in the <stack>,
  <card>, or <group> that does not have its own <foregroundPattern>.


* On Unix systems, the <foregroundPattern> of a <button(keyword)> is
  used for the text of the <button(keyword)>. If the
  <button(object)|button's> <showName> <property> is false, the
  <foregroundPattern> has no effect.


* On Unix systems, the <foregroundPattern> of a <field(keyword)>
  determines the color of the <field(object)|field's> text. If you set
  the <foregroundColor> of a <chunk> of a <field(keyword)>, only that
  <chunk> is affected. The <foregroundPattern> also determines the color
  of the blinking <insertion point> when it is in the <field(keyword)>.


* On Unix systems, the <foregroundPattern> of a <scrollbar(keyword)>
  determines the pattern of the text used to show the <value> of the
  <scrollbar(object)|scrollbar's> current position. If the
  <scrollbar(object)|scrollbar's> <showValue> <property> is false, the
  <foregroundPattern> has no effect.


* The <foregroundPattern> of a <graphic(keyword)> determines the pattern
  used for the <graphic(object)|graphic's> outline. (The <borderPattern>
  determines the pattern used for the <graphic(object)|graphic's>
  border, which is outside the outline.)


* The <foregroundPattern> of a <player>, <image>, <audio clip>, <video
  clip>, or <EPS|EPS object> has no effect. If an object's
  <foregroundPattern> is set, the pattern is shown instead of the color
  specified by <foregroundColor>.


>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS> and <Windows|Windows systems>, the
> <foregroundPattern> applies only to <object(glossary)> borders, not to
> text; text cannot be drawn with a pattern, only with a color.
