Name: formattedHeight

Type: property

Syntax: get the formattedHeight of <object>

Syntax: get the formattedHeight of [<chunk> of] <field>

Summary:
Reports the height needed by an <object(glossary)> to display its full
contents without scrolling.

Associations: card, field, button, player, image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the height of field 1 to the formattedHeight of field 1
put the formattedHeight of the clickLine into selectedHeight

Value:
The <formattedHeight> of an <object(glossary)> is a positive <integer>.
The <object(glossary)> must be on the <current card> of an open <stack>.
This property is read-only and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <formattedHeight> <property> to determine how much vertical
space an <object(glossary)> needs. For example, if your <stack> has a
<field(keyword)> whose contents change for each <card>, use the
<field(object)|field's> <formattedHeight> <property> in an openCard
<handler> to resize the <field(keyword)> for its contents on each
<card>. 

If you specify a card or group, the <formattedHeight> reports the height
of a rectangle that includes all <object|objects> in that <card> or
<group> whose <visible> <property> is true.

If you specify an image or player, the <formattedHeight> <property>
reports the original un-scaled height of the <image> or movie.

If you specify an object in a group, the value reported is the
<formattedHeight> that <object(glossary)> requires for the <current
card>, so if you want to get the <formattedHeight> of a
<field(object)|field's> text on a certain <card>, you must go to that
<card> first.

The <formattedHeight> of a <field(keyword)> is the amount of vertical
space the <field(object)|field's> text requires, taking line breaks into
account and including top and bottom margins.

The <formattedHeight> of a <chunk> in a <field(keyword)> is the amount
of vertical space that portion of the <field(object)|field's> text
requires, taking line breaks into account but disregarding margins.
