Value (bool):The <fullscreen> property of a <stack> is either true or false.
By default, the <fullscreen> property of newly created <stack|stacks> is set to false.

Setting the <fullscreen> of a <stack> causes the <stack> to take up all available space on the screen, this includes space occupied by desktop furniture, for example the Taskbar on Windows and the Dock on Mac OS X.

When the <screenRect> is changed, any <stack> with <fullscreen> set to true will automatically resize to fit the new screen size.

Changing the size or position of a <stack> with <fullscreen> set to true will have no effect.

When a <stack> has its <fullscreen> set from true to false, the rect of the <stack> is restored to the value it had immediately before the <fullscreen> was last set to true.

When a <stack> is full screen, all <decorations> are removed, however the <decorations> property still reports the <decorations> that the <stack> had prior to being made full screen. The <operty)ions.

Description:
Use the <fullscreen> property to change a <stack|stack's> size to make it take up the whole screen.
