-- In a desktop application the fullscreenmode should be set before going to fullscreen:
on mouseUp

Description:
Use the <fullscreenmode> property to choose the most appropriate full
screen scaling mode for the application.

There are multiple ways in which a stack can be resized or scaled to
take full advantage of the available screen space. <fullscreenmode>
allows the developer to choose the most appropriate resizing or scaling
for their application.

>*Note:* The fullscreenmode only takes affect when a stack is full
> screen. This is the case on mobile platforms where
stacks are always full screen, or on the desktop when the <fullscreen>
property of the stack is set to true.

The full screen scaling mode is available on all desktop and mobile
platforms and operates independently from Hi-DPI support.
