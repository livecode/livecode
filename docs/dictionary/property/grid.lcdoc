Introduced: 1.0

Example:

Value (bool):The <grid> is true or false
By default, the <grid> <property> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <grid> <property> to align <object|objects> easily.

If the <grid> <property> is set to true, any <object> the user moves or resizes is moved or resized to the nearest <point> on the grid. If the <object> is moved, its <top> and <left> are multiples of the <gridSize>. If the <object> is resized, its <height> and <width> are multiples of the <gridSize>.

If the <grid> is false, moved and resized <object|objects> are not <constrain|constrained> and are moved to exactly where the user puts them.

The setting of the <grid> <property> does not affect the <move> <command>, or setting <properties> such as the <location> or <rectangle> of the <object>, or nudging <object|objects> a single <pixel> with the arrow keys. Only mouse movements are affected.
