Name: hGrid

Type: property

Syntax: set the hGrid [of line <lineNumber>] of <field> to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether lines are shown below each text line in a <field>.

Associations: field

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the hGrid of field 3 to true

Example:
set the hGrid of line 5 to 10 of field 1 to false

Value (bool):The <hGrid> of a <field(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <hGrid> <property> of newly created <field(object)|fields> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <hGrid> <property> to control the appearance of a <field>.

If a field's <hGrid> <property> is true, a horizontal line is drawn across the <field>, every <textHeight> pixels. The line falls below the lowest part of each <character>, rather than being drawn at the text baseline, as the lines drawn by the <showLines> <property> are.

The lines shown by the <hGrid> and <vGrid> are drawn in the <borderColor> (or <borderPattern>).

If the field's <fixedLineHeight> <property> is set to false, the <hGrid> <property> has no effect.

Changes:
The use of the <borderColor> to draw grid lines was introduced in version 2.0. In previous versions, the grid lines were drawn in the <hiliteColor>.
