Name: height

Type: property

Syntax: set the height of <object> to <numberOfPixels>

Summary:
Specifies the distance from an <object|object's> top edge to its bottom
edge. 

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
put the height of button 1 + the height of button 2 into requiredHeight

Example:
set the height of field thisField to the textHeight of thisField

Value:
The <height> of an <object(glossary)> is a positive integer.

Description:
Use the <height> <property> to determine how much vertical space an
<object(glossary)> needs, or to make it taller or shorter.

If an object's lockLocation <property> is false, when you change its
<height>, it shrinks or grows from the center. The <object|object's> top
and bottom edges both shift, while the <object|object's> <location>
<property> stays the same. If the object's <lockLocation> <property> is
true, it shrinks or grows from the top left corner: the
<object|object's> top edge stays in the same place, and the bottom edge
moves. 

If you reduce the <height> of a <stack>, some <object|objects> may end
up outside the <stack> window. These <object|objects> are not shown;
however, they are still there, and will be displayed if you make the
window tall enough.

The <height> of an object cannot be set to zero. Attempting to do so
will set the <height> to 1 instead.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, the <menu
> bar> normally appears at the top of the screen, rather than inside the
> <stack window>. If a <stack> contains a <menu bar> and the
> <stack|stack's> <editMenus> <property> is set to false, the <stack
> window> is automatically resized so that the <menu bar> <group> is not
> visible in the window. In this case, the <height> of the <stack> is
> the current height of the <stack window>., but the height of the card
> is the height of the total content area of the <stack> (including the
> hidden <menu bar> <group>). This is equal to the <height> of the
> <stack> plus its <vScroll>.

You can set the <height> of a <card(keyword)>, but doing so has no
effect and doesn't change the <card(object)|card's> <height> <property>.

>*Note:* The current architecture uses 16-bit signed integers for all
> co-ordinates, which means that the value range is -32768 to 32767.
