Name: hidden

Type: property

Syntax: set the hidden of <line> of <field> to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether a line of text (paragraph) of a field is hidden from
the user.

Associations: field

Introduced: 5.5

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the hidden of line 2 of field 1 to true

Example:
-- Toggle visibility of a line
if the hidden of line 1 of field 1 is true then
   set the hidden of line 1 of field 1 to false
else
   set the hidden of line 1 of field 1 to true
end if

Value (bool):
The <hidden> of a line of a field is true or false.

Description:
Use the <hidden> property to control whether lines of text in a field
are hidden from the user.

If the <hidden> property of a line of text in a field is set to true,
that line is hidden from the user. The content of the field remains
unchanged however, allowing for the normal data parsing.

For example, take the following content of text in a field and their
associated <hidden> property settings:

This is the text of line 1 -- hidden property 'false'
This is the text of line 2 -- hidden property 'true'
This is the text of line 3 -- hidden property 'false'

The user sees the following:

This is the text of line 1
This is the text of line 3

Executing 'put line 2 of field' results in 'This is the text of line 2'.
