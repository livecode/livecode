Value: The <hilitedButton> of a <group> is an <integer> between zero and the number of <button|buttons> in the <group>.

Description:
Use the <hilitedButton> <property> to change the current setting in a <radio button|radio-button cluster>.

The <hilitedButton> specifies which <button(keyword)> in a <group> is currently <highlight|highlighted>. If the <hilitedButton> of a <group> is zero, none of the <button(object)|buttons> in the <group> is currently <highlight|highlighted>. If the <hilitedButton> is 1, the <button(keyword)> with the lowest <layer> in the <group> is currently <highlight|highlighted>; if the <hilitedButton> is 2, the <button(keyword)> with the second-lowest <layer> is currently <highlight|highlighted>; and so forth.

Setting the <hilitedButton> of a <group> sets the <hilite> <property> of the rest of the <button(object)|buttons> to false.

The <hilitedButton> <property> is most useful in <radio button|radio-button clusters>. In a <radio button|radio-button cluster>, only one <button(keyword)> can be <highlight|highlighted> at once:  clicking another <button(keyword)> unhighlights the first one. The <radioBehavior> <property> of a <group> of <button(object)|buttons> specifies whether they act as a <radio button|radio-button cluster>.

The <hilitedButton>, <hilitedButtonName(property)>, and <hilitedButtonID(property)> <property|properties> all refer in different ways to the same <button(object)>. When any of them changes, all of them change.
