A mouse cursor, regardless of its shape, always has a single active point or hot spot. For example, the arrow cursor's hot spot is at its tip, and to select an object, you must click it with the arrow tip.

The first item of the <hotSpot> <property> is the horizontal distance in <pixels> from the left edge of the <image(keyword)> to the hot spot <point>, and is equal to the <image(object)|image's> <xHot> <property>. The second <item> of the <hotSpot> <property> is the vertical distance in <pixels> from the top of the <image(keyword)> to the hot spot <point>, and is equal to the <image(object)|image's> <yHot> <property>.
