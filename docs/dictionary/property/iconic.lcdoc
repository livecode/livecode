Summary: Specifies whether a <stack window> is <minimize|minimized>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

Example:
set the iconic of this stack to true

Value (bool):The <iconic> of a <stack> is true or false.
By default, the <iconic> <property> of newly created <stacks> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <iconic> <property> to change a <stack|stack's> appearance in order to make it take up less screen space.

Set a stack's <iconic> <property> to true to make the <stack window> take up less space. The way in which this is done depends on the <platform> :

        * On Mac OS systems, the window is collapsed to its title bar
        * On OS X systems, the window is collapsed to an icon in the Dock
        * On Unix systems, the window is iconified into a desktop icon
        * On Windows systems, the window is minimized to an icon in the task bar

If the user has collapsed, iconified, or minimized the stack, its <iconic> <property> reports true.

Changes:
Support for setting the iconic of a stack on OS X systems was added in version 2.0.
