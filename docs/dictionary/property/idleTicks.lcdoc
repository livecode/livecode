Name: idleTicks

Type: property

Syntax: set the idleTicks to <number> 

Summary: Specifies the number of <ticks> between <idle>, <mouseStillDown>, and <mouseWithin> <message|messages>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the idleTicks to 60 -- 1 second interval

Value:
The <idleTicks> is a positive integer.
By default, the <idleTicks> <property> is set to 12 (one-fifth of a second).

Description:
Adjust the <idleTicks> <property> to change the interval between periodically-sent <message|messages>. Increasing the <idleTicks> causes these <message|messages> to be sent less frequently, and decreases the amount of CPU time the <application> uses.

The <idleTicks> is the time in <ticks> between one <idle> <message> and the next, one <mouseStillDown> <message> and the next, and one <mouseWithin> <message> and the next.

>*Important:*  Some <Unix|Unix systems> cannot reliably time an interval less than 12 <ticks>. Setting a shorter <idleTicks> on those systems may cause <idle> messages to be sent at erratic times.

This property is very similar to the <idleRate> <property>, and changes when the <idleRate> changes. The only difference is that the two <properties> are given in different time units:  the <idleRate> is in <milliseconds> and the <idleTicks> is in <ticks>.
