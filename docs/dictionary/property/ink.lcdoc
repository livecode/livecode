Name: ink

Type: property

Syntax: set the ink of <object> to <inkMode>

Summary:
Specifies the kind of transparency an <object(glossary)> is drawn with.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the ink of graphic "Floating" to blendClear

Example:
set the ink of field "Ghost" to blendPlus

Parameters:
object:
the name of the object

inkmode:
the name of the ink

Value (enum):
The <ink> of an <object(glossary)> is a <string> designating one of 48
<transfer mode|transfer modes>.By default, the <ink> of newly created
<object|objects> is "srcCopy"


Description:
Use the <ink> <property> to specify how the color of each <pixel> of an
<object(glossary)> combines with the color of the <pixel> underneath it
to create the final color shown on the screen.

The srcCopy mode simply puts the <object(glossary)> on top of the
<background>; the <background> does not show through or affect the final
color at all.

You can use other transfer modes with the <ink> <property> to create
special transparent or partially transparent effects, or to invert the
colors of an <object(glossary)> or the colors underneath the
<object(glossary)>, or to combine the <object|object's> colors with the
colors under the <object(glossary)>.

There are 25 transfer modes:

Structural Blends (Porter Duff operators):

* blendClear
* blendSrc
* blendDst
* blendSrcOver
* blendDstOver
* blendSrcIn
* blendDstIn
* blendSrcOut
* blendDstOut
* blendSrcAtop
* blendDstAtop
* blendXor


Image Processing Blends (SVG/PDF operators):

* blendPlus
* blendMultiply
* blendScreen
* blendOverlay
* blendDarken
* blendLighten
* blendDodge
* blendBurn
* blendHardLight
* blendSoftLight
* blendDifference
* blendExclusion


Bitwise - This ink has been deprecated from version 5.0

* srcCopy

The rendered pixels of an object are combined with the corresponding
background pixels using the specified ink before the blendLevel is
applied. 

>*Note:* Most of the structural blends require that an ancestor of the
> object be a container with an alpha channel. If this is not the case
> the behaviour of the blend is undefined. Containers (cards and groups)
> can be forced to have an alpha channel by setting their ink to
> something other than srcCopy, or by setting their blendLevel to
> something other than 0.
