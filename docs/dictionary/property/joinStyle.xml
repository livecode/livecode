    <p>This property can be set for the line, freehand polygon and freehand line graphic types.  There are three possible property settings, the effects of which are as follows;</p><p/><p><i>bevel</i>        - a straight line is drawn between the outer edges of the adjoining lines.</p><p><i>round</i>       - a circular arc is drawn between the outer edges of the adjoining lines.</p><p><i>miter</i>        - outer edges are extended to meet at a sharp point.  If the distance from the corner exceeds the miter</p><p>             limit, a bevel join is used for the corner.</p><p/><p><b>Note:</b> This only affects polygon, freehand curve and line graphics which have their antialiased set to true.</p>
