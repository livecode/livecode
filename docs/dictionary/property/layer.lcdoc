Name: layer

Synonyms: partnumber

Type: property

Syntax: set the layer of <object> to {<layerNumber> | top | bottom}

Summary:
Specifies the back-to-front order of <object|objects> on a
<card(keyword)> or the order of <card(object)|cards> in a <stack>.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the layer of the mouseControl to top -- bring to front

Example:
set the layer of last card button to 10

Example:
set the layer of player "Splash" to (the number of controls)

Value:
The <layer> <property> of a control or <card> is an <integer>.

Description:
Use the <layer> <property> to change the tab order of
<control(object)|controls>, or to change the order of
<card(object)|cards> within a <stack>.

If the <object(glossary)> is a <control(keyword)>, it must appear on the
<current card> in order for its <layer> to be changed; you can't set the
<layer> of a <control(keyword)> on another <card(keyword)>.

The <layer> of a <control(keyword)> is its order (from back to front) on
the <card(keyword)>. If two <control(object)|controls> overlap, the one
that covers the other has a higher <layer>. Each control is on a
different <layer>.

To bring a control forward, set its <layer> to a higher number. To send
it back, set its <layer> to a lower number. You use the form set the
layer of <object(glossary)> to top to bring the control all the way to
the front, and set the layer of <object(glossary)> to bottom
to send it all the way to the back.

If you set the <layer> of a <control(keyword)> to a number greater than
the number of <control(object)|controls> on the card, its <layer> is set
equal to the number of <control(object)|controls>.

The <layer> of <control(object)|controls> also determines the tab order.
When you press the Tab key, the next <control(keyword)> whose
<traversalOn> <property> is true becomes the <active (focused)
control(glossary)>. For example, to set the tab order of
<field(object)|fields> in a data entry form, set the <layer> of each
<field(keyword)> so that they are in order.

The <layer> of a <group> determines the back-to-front position of all
the <control(object)|controls> in the group at once. The <group> behaves
as a single <control(keyword)>, as far as its <layer> is concerned. When
you group or ungroup a <group>, its <control(object)|controls> retain
the same back-to-front placement relative to each other, but the <group>
as a whole moves to the front. The <layer> of a <group> is one less than
the <layer> of the lowest-layered <object(glossary)> in the <group>.

It is not possible for other controls to be interspersed between the
controls in a single group. If the <relayerGroupedControls> <property>
is set to true, and you set the <layer> of a <grouped control> to a
number greater than the topmost <control(keyword)> in the <group>, or
lower than the bottom-most <control(keyword)> in the <group>, the
<control(keyword)> is moved out of the <group>. If the
<relayerGroupedControls> is false, you cannot set the <layer> of a
<grouped control> without being in <group-editing mode>.

The <layer> of a <card(keyword)> specifies its position in the <stack>.
Setting the <layer> of a <card(keyword)> moves it to the specified
position in the <stack>.

Changing the <layer> of an <object(glossary)> also changes its <number>
<property>.
