Name: liveResizing

Type: property

Syntax: set the liveResizing of <stack> to {true | false}

Summary: Causes a <stack window> to display its contents changing during resizing, instead of redrawing the contents after the window is resized.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 2.1

OS:

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the liveResizing of stack "Hello World" to false

Example:
set the liveResizing of me to true

Value (bool): The <liveResizing> <property> of a <stack> is true or false. By <default>, the <liveResizing> of a newly created <stack> is set to false.

Description:
**Note:** The <liveResizing> property is deprecated, since it has no effect on any operating system currently supported by LiveCode.  Its value is always treated as true.

Use the <liveResizing> property to create a smooth visual appearance while resizing.

When the <liveResizing> <property> is true, the window contents (including the borders) are redrawn continuously as the user resizes, so at any time, the window is displayed as it will look if the user releases the mouse button at that moment.

If the <liveResizing> is false, the window does not change until the user releases the mouse and stops resizing.

If the <liveResizing> is true, <resizeStack> <message|messages> are sent continually while the window is being resized, allowing your stack to update its appearance during resizing. (If the user pauses during resizing, with the mouse down in the resize box but the pointer not moving, no <resizeStack> <message> is sent until the mouse moves again.)
