Value:
The <location> of an <object> is any <expression> that <evaluate|evaluates> to a <point> --two integers separated by a comma.
The first item of the <location> is the distance in <pixels> from the left edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> (for other objects) to the center of the <object>. The second <item> is the distance in <pixels> from the top edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> (for other objects) to the center of the <object>.

For cards, the <location> <property> is <read-only> and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <location> <property> to move an <object> without resizing it, or to find out where an <object> is.

The <location> of a <stack> is in <absolute (screen) coordinates(glossary)>. The first <item> of a <card|card's> <location> <property> is equal to the width of stack div 2; the second item is is equal to the height of stack div 2. The <location> of a <group> or <control> is in <relative (window) coordinates(glossary)>.

In window coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the stack window. In screen coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the screen.

Changing the <location> of an <object> moves it to the new position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> size, set its <height>, <width>, or <rectangle> <properties>.
