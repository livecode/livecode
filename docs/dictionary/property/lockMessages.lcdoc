Name: lockMessages

Type: property

Syntax: set the lockMessages to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether <setProp trigger|setProp triggers>, <getProp call|getProp calls>, and certain <built-in message|built-in messages> are sent automatically.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the lockMessages to false

Value (bool):The <lockMessages> is true or false
By default, the <lockMessages> <property> is set to false. It is <reset> to false when no <handler|handlers> are <execute|executing>.

Description:
Use the <lockMessages> <property> to prevent unwanted <handler|handlers> from being <trigger|triggered>,or to speed up operations when <handler|handlers> that are normally run automatically are not needed.

If the <lockMessages> <property> is set to true, the following are not sent:

        * Navigation messages (such as openCard, <closeStack>, and so on) 
        * Object creation messages (such as newCard, <newButton>, and so on)
        * getProp calls
        * setProp triggers

It is useful to set this property if a handler temporarily visits a card and you don't want the normal messages to be triggered.

The <lockMessages> <property> is automatically set to false when a <palette>, <modeless>, or <modal> <stack> is opened, even if a <handler> is still running.
