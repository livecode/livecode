Summary: Has no effect and is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with imported <HyperCard> stacks.

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Description:
In HyperCard, the <longWindowTitles> <property> determines whether a <stack window|stack window's> <title bar> shows the <absolute file path|full path> to a <stack>, or only the <stack|stack's> name. In LiveCode, the <stack|stack's> <label> <property> is shown as the window title; if the <label> is empty, the short version of the <stack|stack's> <name> <property> is shown.

A handler can set the <longWindowTitles> without causing a <error|script error>, but the actual window title is not changed. The <default> value is false<a/>.
