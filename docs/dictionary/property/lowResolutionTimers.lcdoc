Name: lowResolutionTimers

Type: property

Syntax: set the lowResolutionTimers to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies which operating-system mechanism is used to compute times on <Windows|Windows systems>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: windows

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the lowResolutionTimers to true

Value (bool):The <lowResolutionTimers> is true or false.
By default, the <lowResolutionTimers> <property> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <lowResolutionTimers> <property> to improve performance on <Windows|Windows systems>.

If the <lowResolutionTimers> <property> is set to true, timing intervals are measured with the operating system's WM_TIMER <message|messages>. If the <lowResolutionTimers> is false, timing intervals are measured with the high-precision multimedia timers.

The high-precision timers are sometimes unreliable, causing delays in the action of the <move> and <wait> <command|commands>. You can fix these symptoms by setting the <lowResolutionTimers> to true. However, using the WM_TIMER <message|messages> may cause jerkiness in the action of the <move> <command>.

The setting of this property has no effect on Mac OS and Unix systems.
