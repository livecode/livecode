Use the <magnify> <property> to edit an <image> <pixel> -by- <pixel>.

When you set the <magnify> of an <image> to true, a <palette> appears displaying a close-up view of the center of the <image>. At the same time, a box appears in the <stack window> showing you what portion of the <image> is magnified. Drag this box by its edges to magnify different parts of the <image>. In the Magnify <palette>, you use the <paint tool|paint tools> to change the <image>.

Setting the <magnify> of the <image> to false hides the Magnify <palette>.

You can also show the Magnify palette by choosing the Pencil tool and Command-clicking the image (on Mac OS systems) or Control-clicking it (on Unix and Windows systems). This action selects the image, so if the image is part of a group, either the editGroupedControls <property> must be true, or you must be in <group-editing mode>.
