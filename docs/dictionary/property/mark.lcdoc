Value (bool):The <mark> of a <card(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <mark> <property> of newly created <card(object)|cards> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <mark> <property> to <select> a subset of <card(object)|cards> for <sort|sorting>, printing, or further searching.

The <mark> <property> of a <card(keyword)> can be used to narrow down the action of several <command|commands>. For example, you can use the <go> command in forms such as go to next marked card. The <sort> <command> can be restricted to <sort|sorting> only marked <card(object)|cards>.

You can also use the <mark> and <unmark> <command|commands> to change a <card(object)|card's> <mark> <property>.

This property is the equivalent of the "marked" property in HyperCard.
