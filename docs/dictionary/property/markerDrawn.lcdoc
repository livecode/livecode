Use the <markerDrawn> <property> to draw a small shape at each <vertex> of a <graphic>.

Irregular polygon graphics can be drawn with a marker at each vertex, whose shape is defined by the markerPoints <property>. The <markerDrawn> <property> specifies whether these markers are visible or not.

The borderPattern and <borderColor> <properties> determine the appearance of the markers' interior. The <hilitePattern> and <hiliteColor> determine the appearance of the borders.

If the style <property> of the <graphic> is not polygon or curve, the setting of its markerPattern <property> has no effect.

If the markerPoints <property> is empty, the setting of the <markerDrawn> <property> has no effect.
