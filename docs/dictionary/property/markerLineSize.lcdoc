Use the <markerLineSize> <property> to change the appearance of the small shapes at each <vertex> of a <graphic>.

Irregular polygon graphics can be drawn with a marker at each vertex. The <markerLineSize> <property> specifies the width of the line that outlines each marker. The marker's shape is determined by the <markerPoints> <property>, and its outline color is determined by the <hiliteColor> <property>.

If the style <property> of the <graphic> is not polygon or curve, the setting of its markerPattern <property> has no effect.

If the <markerPoints> <property> is empty or the <markerDrawn> <property> is false, the <markerLineSize> <property> has no effect.
