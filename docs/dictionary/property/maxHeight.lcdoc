Name: maxHeight

Type: property

Syntax: set the maxHeight of <stack> to <pixels> 

Summary: Specifies how tall a <stack window> can be made when it's being resized.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the maxHeight of stack "Help" to 500

Example:
set the maxHeight of the target to (item 2 of the screenRect - 48)

Value:
The <maxHeight> of a stack is a positive <integer>.
By default, the <maxHeight> <property> of newly created <stacks> is set to 65535.

Description:
Use the <maxHeight> <property> if you want the user to be able to resize the <stack window>, but limited to a height you choose.

The <maxHeight> is the maximum height in <pixels>. The height does not include the window's <title bar> or borders.

The <maxHeight> <property> does not prevent a <handler> from changing the <stack|stack's> <height> <property> (or related <properties> such as the <rectangle>). It affects only user actions. If you set the <stack|stack's> height to a value greater than the <maxHeight>, it is <reset> to the <maxHeight> when you close and reopen the <stack>.

If the stack's resizable <property> is false, the setting of this <property> has no effect.

>*Note:* The current architecture uses 16-bit signed integers for all co-ordinates, which means that the value range is -32768 to 32767.
