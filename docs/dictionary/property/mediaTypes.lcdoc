Description:
Use the <mediaTypes> <property> to find out what kinds of media a
<QuickTime> movie contains. 

Most QuickTime movies provide more than one media type. For example, a
typical movie might provide one video and one audio track. 

If more than one track in the movie uses the same media type, the media
type is specified only once in the <mediaTypes> property. For example,
"audio" appears only once in the <mediaTypes>, even if the movie
contains more than one audio track. 

Changes:
This property was removed from the Windows platform in version 8.1.0,
due to the change of player implementation from QuickTime to
DirectShow.
