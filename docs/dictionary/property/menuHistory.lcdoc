Name: menuHistory

Type: property

Syntax: set the menuHistory of <button> to <itemNumber> 

Summary: Specifies the number of the currently <selected> item of the <menu> that belongs to a <button>.

Associations: button

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the menuHistory of button "Tabs" to 1

Value:
The <menuHistory> of a <button(keyword)> is an <integer> between 1 and the number of <menu item|menu items> in the <menu>.
By default, the <menuHistory> <property> of newly created <button(object)|buttons> is set to 1.

Description:
Use the <menuHistory> <property> to change the selected item in a <menu>, or to find out which <menu item> is currently selected.

When you set the <menuHistory> <property>, a <menuPick> <message> is sent to the <button(keyword)>.

If the button's menuMode is "comboBox", setting its <menuHistory> also changes the <button(object)|button's> <label> to the new <menu item>.

If the button's menuMode is "tabbed", setting its <menuHistory> also changes the active tab.

If the button's menuMode is "option", setting its <menuHistory> changes the <label>. It also determines which <menu item> is under the <mouse pointer> when the <menu> next appears. Make sure to set the <menuHistory> <property> of an option menu whenever you change the current choice, so that the choice is under the <mouse pointer> when the user clicks the menu.

>*Note:* The effect of the <menuHistory> <property> in <cascading menu|cascading menus> is ambiguous. Avoid setting or relying on the <menuHistory> of a <cascading menu>.
