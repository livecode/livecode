Value (enum): The <menuMode> of a <button> is one of pullDown, cascade, popup, tabbed, comboBox, or option

Description:
Use the <menuMode> <property> to specify the <appearance> and <behavior> of the menu associated with a <button(keyword)>.

Any button's contents can be viewed as a menu if the button's style <property> is set to "menu". The <menuMode> setting creates <menus> of different types from the <button(object)|button's> contents. (You set the <button(object)|button's> contents with the <text> <property>.)

You can also associate a stack with the button, using the <menuName> <property>. In this case, the contents of the <stack|stack's> first <card> are displayed as a <menu>.

* "pulldown":  Displays each <line> of the <button(object)|button's> contents as a <menu item> in a normal pulldown menu. Use this <menuMode> for <button(object)|buttons> that are grouped into a <menubar>.

  Setting a button's <menuMode> to "pulldown" has the same result as creating the equivalent <menu item|menu items> (as <button(object)|buttons>) in a <stack>, then using the <pulldown> command to display the <stack> as a <menu>.

  **Note:** On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, pulldown menus in a window are drawn by the standard operating system routines if the <button(object)|button's> <showBorder> <property> is set to true and its <borderWidth> is not zero. Pulldown menus in the <menu bar> are always drawn by the operating system.

* "cascade":  Displays each <line> of the <button(object)|button's> contents as a <menu item> in a <cascading menu|hierarchical menu>. (The <button(keyword)> must be part of a <stack menu>.)

* "popup":  Displays each <line> of the <button(object)|button's> contents as a <menu item> in a <popup menu>. The <menu> appears at the <point> of the mouse click.

  Setting a button's <menuMode> to "popup" has the same result as creating the equivalent <menu item|menu items> (as <button(object)|buttons>) in a <stack>, then using the <popup> <command> to display the <stack> as a <menu>.

* "tabbed":  Displays the <button(object)|button's> contents as a horizontal list of tabs, like the tabs on <file> <folders>. Each <line> of the <button(object)|button's> contents is the title of a tab. Usually, <tabbed button|tabbed buttons> are used for <dialog box|dialog boxes> or <palette|palettes> containing a different <group> of <control|controls> for each tab. You can <handle> the <menuPick> <message> to display the correct <group> when a tab is clicked:

      on menuPick newTab,oldTab -- sent when user clicks a tab
         lock screen -- hide the swap
         hide group oldTab
         show group newTab
         unlock screen
      end menuPick

* "comboBox":  Displays the <button(object)|button's> contents as a drop-down scrolling list, with an editable <field> at the top.

  **Note:** If a <button(object)|button's> <menuMode> is set to "comboBox", the <button(keyword)> receives <field> <message|messages>. For example, when the user clicks in the editable <field(object)>, an <openField> <message> is sent to the <button(keyword)>.

* "option":  Displays an option menu (when the <lookAndFeel> <property> is set to "Motif"), a drop-down list (when the <lookAndFeel> <property> is set to "Windows 95"), or a Mac-style <popup menu> (when the <lookAndFeel> <property> is set to "Appearance Manager" or "Macintosh"). Setting a <button(object)|button's> <menuMode> to option has the same result as creating the equivalent menu items (as <button(object)|buttons>) in a <stack>, then using the <option> <command> to display the <stack> as a menu.

Regardless of the <menuMode>, a <menuPick> <message> is sent to the <button(keyword)> when the user chooses a <menu item> from the <menu>.

If the button's style <property> is not set to "menu", the setting of its <menuMode> <property> has no effect.
