Description:
Use the <metadata> property to store additional information in a field that is not visible to a user. Metadata can be specified for any field chunk; char, word and line as well as ranges (e.g. word 2 to 5).

The ability to add metadata at the paragraph level was added in version 6.0. Like metadata at the char level, you can now 'set the metadata of line ... of ...' and it will be attached to the paragraph, a level above the char properties. This means if you want to set the metadata on the char level for a whole line you must do 'set the metadata of char 1 to -1 of line .. of ...', rather than just 'of line'.
