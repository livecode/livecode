Name: minHeight

Type: property

Syntax: set the minHeight of <stack> to <pixels> 

Summary: Specifies how short a <stack window> can be made when it's resized.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the minHeight of this stack to the height of this stack

Value:
The <minHeight> of a <stack> is a positive <integer>.
By default, the <minHeight> <property> of newly created <stacks> is set to 32.

Description:
Use the <minHeight> <property> if you want the user to be able to resize the <stack window>, but no smaller than a height you choose. For example, you might want to let the user make the <stack> smaller, but not so small that the <stack|stack's> navigation buttons can't be displayed.

The <minHeight> is the minimum height in <pixels>. The height does not include the window's <title bar> or borders.

The <minHeight> <property> does not prevent a <handler> from changing the <stack|stack's> <height> <property> (or related <properties> such as the <rectangle>). It affects only user actions. If you set the <stack|stack's> height to a value less than the <minHeight>, it is <reset> to the <minHeight> when you close and reopen the <stack>.

If the stack's <resizable> <property> is false, the setting of this <property> has no effect.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, if the <current card> has a <menu bar> and the <editMenus> <property> is false (that is, if the <stack window> is scrolled up so the menubar buttons are not visible in the window), the <minHeight> does not include the height of the <menu bar>. However, on <Windows> and <Unix|Unix systems>, the <minHeight> includes the height of the <menu bar>, since on these platforms the <menu bar> is in the <stack window>. This means that if you set a <minHeight> for a <stack> that contains a <menu bar>, you may need to adjust it depending on <platform> so that the <minHeight> on <Unix> and <Windows|Windows systems> includes the height of the <menu bar>, while the <minHeight> on <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems> does not. (The standard height of <menu bar|menu bars> created with the <Menu Builder> is 21 pixels.)

>*Note:* The current architecture uses 16-bit signed integers for all co-ordinates, which means that the value range is -32768 to 32767.
