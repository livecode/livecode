Name: minWidth

Type: property

Syntax: set the minWidth of <stack> to <pixels> 

Summary: Specifies how narrow a <stack window> can be made when it's resized.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the minWidth of this stack to 200

Value:
The <minWidth> of a stack is a positive <integer>.
By default, the <minWidth> <property> of newly created <stacks> is set to 32.

Description:
Use the <minWidth> <property> if you want the user to be able to resize the <stack window>, but no smaller than a width you choose. For example, you might want to let the user make the <stack> smaller, but not so small that the <stack|stack's> navigation <button|buttons> can't be displayed.

The <minWidth> is the minimum width in <pixels>. The height does not include the window's <title bar> or borders.

The <minWidth> <property> does not prevent a <handler> from changing the <stack|stack's> <width> <property> (or related <properties> such as the <rectangle>). It affects only user actions. If you set the <stack|stack's> width to a <value> less than the <minWidth>, it is <reset> to the <minWidth> when you close and reopen the <stack>.

If the stack's resizable <property> is false, the setting of this <property> has no effect.

>*Note:* The current architecture uses 16-bit signed integers for all co-ordinates, which means that the value range is -32768 to 32767.
