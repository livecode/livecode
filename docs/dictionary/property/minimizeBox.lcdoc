Name: minimizeBox

Type: property

Syntax: set the minimizeBox of <stack> to {true | false}

Summary: Shows a window's <minimize button|minimize box> or <collapse box>.

Synonyms: collapseBox

Associations: stack

Introduced: 2.1

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the minimizeBox of me to true
set the minimizeBox of the templateStack to false

Value (bool): The <minimizeBox> <property> of a <stack> is true or false. By <default>, the <minimizeBox> of a newly created <stack> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <minimizeBox> property to display the collapse box or minimize box in a window's title bar.

The terminology varies depending on platform. The <minimizeBox> <property> determines whether the <collapse box> (<Mac OS|Mac OS systems>), <minimize button|minimize box> (OS X and <Windows|Windows systems>) or <iconify> box (<Unix|Unix systems>) appears in a <stack window|stack window's> <title bar>.

>*Note:* On <OS X|OS X systems>, if the <minimizeBox> <property> is false, the <minimize button|minimize box> is disabled rather than hidden.

The setting of this property affects the decorations property, and vice versa. Setting a stack's <minimizeBox> property determines whether its decorations property includes "minimize" (or is "default", for window styles that normally include a minimize box). Conversely, setting a stack's decorations property sets its <minimizeBox> to true or false depending on whether the decorations includes "minimize" (or is "default").

Setting the <minimizeBox> <property> causes the <stack window> to flash briefly.
