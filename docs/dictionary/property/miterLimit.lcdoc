Name: miterLimit

Type: property

Syntax: set the miterLimit [of graphic] to <number> 

Summary: Specifies how far miter joins can extend from the meeting point of two edges before a bevel join is used.

Associations: graphic

Introduced: 3.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the miterLimit of graphic "polygon 1" of this card to 5

Parameters:
number (integer): An integer that is a multiple of the current lineSize of the graphic.

Value (integer): The <miterLimit> property returns an integer that is a multiple of the current lineSize of the graphic.

Description:
Set the <miterLimit> property to specify how far miter joins can extend from the meeting point of two edges before a bevel join is used.

The <miterLimit> is used to calculate the maximum size of a miter join before it is rendered as a bevel.  The size of a miter join is the length in pixels from the corner to the intersection point of its outer two edges.  The <miterLimit> is specified as a multiple of the current <lineSize> of the graphic.

>*Note:* This only affects polygon, freehand curve and line graphics which have their antialiased set to true.
