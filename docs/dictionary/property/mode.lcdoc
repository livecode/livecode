Value:

This property is read-only and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <mode> <property> to determine how the user can interact with the <stack>.

The <mode> of a <stack> is one of the following numbers:

Mode | Meaning | Description
:----------:|:---------|:---------
0|closed but loaded|The stack window is closed, but the stack is still in memory. A stack can have this <mode> if its <destroyStack> <property> is set to false and the stack has been opened, then closed.
1|editable window|The stack is open and displayed in an editable window. A stack has this <mode> if its <style> is "topLevel" or if it was opened with the <topLevel> <command>.
2|non-editable window|The stack is open and displayed in a normal window, but is not editable.  A stack has this <mode> if its <style> is "topLevel" or if it was opened with the <topLevel> <command>, and the <stack|stack's> <cantModify> <property> is set to true.
3|modeless dialog|The stack is open and displayed as a modeless dialog box.  A stack has this <mode> if its <style> is "modeless" or if it was opened with the <modeless> command
4|palette|The stack is open and displayed as a palette.  A <stack> has this <mode> if its <style> is "palette" or if it was opened with the <palette> <command>.
5|modal dialog|The stack is open and displayed as a modal dialog box.  A stack has this <mode> if its <style> is "modal" or if it was opened with the <modal> <command>.
6|sheet|The stack is open and displayed as a sheet.  A stack has this <mode> if it was opened with the <sheet> <command>. (If the <sheet> <command> was used on a <platform> other than <OS X>, the <stack> is displayed as a <modal dialog box> instead of a <sheet>. In this case, its <mode> is 5.)
7|pulldown stack menu|The stack is open and displayed as a pulldown menu.  A stack has this <mode> if it was opened with the <pulldown> <command>, or if it is the menuStack of a <button> whose <style> is set to "menu" and whose <menuMode> is set to pulldown.
8|popup stack menu|The stack is open and displayed as a <popup menu>.  A <stack> has this <mode> if it was opened with the <popup> <command>, or if it is the menuStack of a <button> whose <style> is set to "menu" and whose <menuMode> is set to "popup".
9|option stack menu|The stack is open and displayed as an option menu.  A stack has this <mode> if it is the menuStack of a <button> whose <style> is set to "menu" and whose <menuMode> is set to "option".
10|submenu in a stack menu|The stack is open and displayed as a cascading menu.  A stack has this <mode> if it is the menuStack of a <button> whose <style> is set to "menu" and whose <menuMode> is set to "cascade".
11|combo box stack menu|The stack is open and displayed as a combo box.  A stack has this <mode> if it is the menuStack of a <button> whose <style> is set to "menu" and whose <menuMode> is set to "comboBox".
12|collapsed|The stack is open but has been collapsed (Mac OS), iconified (Unix), or minimized (Windows).
13|drawer|The stack is open as a drawer beside another window. A stack has this <mode> if it was opened with the <drawer> <command>.

If two stacks with different modes are open, the stack whose <mode> 
<property> is lower takes precedence when determining which <stack> is 
the <topStack>. This means, for example, that menu items (such as 
Object menu > Stack Properties that act on the current <stack> may not 
be able to operate correctly with a stack whose <cantModify> is set to 
true (and whose <mode> is therefore 2) as long as another, modifiable 
stack (<mode> equal to 1) is open.
