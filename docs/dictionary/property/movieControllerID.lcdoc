Name: movieControllerID

Type: property

Syntax: get the movieControllerID of <player> 

Summary: Reports a pointer to a movie's controller.

Associations: player

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
put the movieControllerID of player "Intro" into field "IDs"

Example:
get myLink(the movieControllerID of player 3) -- an example external

Value:
The <movieControllerID> of a <stack> is an <integer>.
The <movieControllerID> <property> is <read-only> and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <movieControllerID> <property> to pass to an <external> that
needs to manipulate the <player>. 

The controller ID is provided by the operating system.

Some externals need to manipulate the QuickTime movie directly, and do
so by referencing the ID. Such externals require you to pass the ID when
you use the external. 

Deprecated: In order to support 64-bit on Mac we have been required to
switch to using AVFoundation on Mac, which does not support this
feature. In addition, the Windows player object is now based on
DirectShow, as Apple have dropped support for the QuickTime libraries
previously used. 

Changes:
This property was deprecated in version 8.1.0 due to the retirement of
the QuickTime player implementation.
