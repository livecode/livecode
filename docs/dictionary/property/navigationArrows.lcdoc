Value (bool):The <navigationArrows> can be set to true or false.
By default, the <navigationArrows> <property> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <navigationArrows> <property> to control what the arrow keys do.

If the <navigationArrows> is true, pressing the keyboard arrow keys moves to a different <card> :

        * The Left arrow key moves to the previous card.
        * The Right arrow key moves to the next card.
        * The Up arrow key moves backward within the recent-cards list.
        * The Down arrow key moves forward within the recent-cards list.

If there is an insertion point or text selection in a field, and the textArrows <property> is set to true, the arrow keys move the insertion <point> one <character> left or right, or one line up or down. In this case, the setting of the <navigationArrows> <property> has no effect.

If an object is selected, pressing the arrow keys nudges the object one pixel in the appropriate direction.
