lineEnding (enum): The type of line ending to use.

- cr: Not normally used on modern systems

Description:
Use the <outputTextEncoding> property to determine what text conversion to perform when writing text strings to stdout.

<outputTextEncoding> is only available when running in CGI mode (Server).

The quoted literals *must* be used when setting this property - the property expects a name not a sequence of bytes to use as the line-ending. The reason behind this is two-fold - (1) it is more 'correct' from the point of view it is identifying the style of line-ending rather than the sequence of bytes to use (2) 'cr' and 'lf' are defined as the same numToChar(10) constant on all platforms.
