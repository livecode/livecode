Name: paintCompression

Type: property

Syntax: get the paintCompression of <image> 

Syntax: set the paintCompression to {png | jpeg | gif | rle}

Summary: Specifies the <compress|compression> <format> used for storing an <image>.

Introduced: 1.1

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the paintCompression to "PNG"

Example:
if the paintCompression of image "Photo" is "pict" then warnUser

Value (enum): A string describing the compression format.
- png:
- jpeg:
- gif:
- rle:
- pict:

The result: >*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, <PICT> <files> can be <import|imported>, and the <paintCompression> of the resulting <image(keyword)> is set to pict. However, PICT <image(object)|images> cannot be displayed on <Unix> or <Windows|Windows systems> unless they are converted to another <format>.

Description:
Use the <paintCompression> <property> to obtain the <format> of <image(object)|images>, or to change the <format> used for new <image(object)|images>.

When an image is changed with a paint tool, it is recompressed the next time you leave the card it's on. The format in which it is compressed is set by the global <paintCompression> <property>.

To change an image's compression format, first set the <paintCompression> to the desired value, then paint in the <image(keyword)>. Then either go to another <card> and return, or close and re-open the <stack>.

If an image's alphaData <property> contains any value other than 255 (opaque), it is automatically recompressed in PNG format to preserve the <alpha channel> data.

By <default>, the <global> <paintCompression> <property> is set to "rle" in standalones and "png" in the development environment.The <paintCompression> of an <image> is one of the following: "png", "jpeg", "gif", "rle", or "pict". By <default>, the <paintCompression> <property> of a newly created <image> is set to "rle" if it was created with the <create> <command> or by using a <paint tool>. If the <image> was created with the <import> <command>, its <paintCompression> is set to the <format> of the <import|imported> picture <file>.For images, this property is read-only and cannot be set; you can set only the global <paintCompression>
