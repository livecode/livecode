Name: palindromeFrames

Type: property

Syntax: set the palindromeFrames of <image> to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies that a looping <animated GIF> plays forward and backward.

Associations: image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the palindromeFrames of image "Construction" to true

Value (bool):The <palindromeFrames> of an <image(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <palindromeFrames> <property> of newly created <image(object)|images> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <palindromeFrames> <property> to change the way an <animated GIF> <image> repeats itself.

An animated GIF image can be set to loop over and over, instead of playing the animation once and then stopping. If the <palindromeFrames> <property> is set to true, the <image> plays forward, then plays backward from the end, then plays forward again, and so on.

If the <palindromeFrames> is false, the <image> plays from the beginning to the end, then skips back to the beginning to start the next loop.

If the contents of the image is not an animated GIF, or the image's repeatCount is zero, the setting of the <palindromeFrames> <property> has no effect.
