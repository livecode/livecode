Name: password

Type: property

Syntax: set the password of <stack> to {<passwordString> | empty}

Summary: Specifies a <password> that the user must enter before making changes to the <stack>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the password of stack "Secrets" to field "Password"

Example:
set the password of this stack to empty -- remove password

Value: The <password> of a <stack> is a <string>.

Description:
Use the <password> <property> to <encrypt> a <stack|stack's> contents, allowing access only from within the application.

&nbsp;

By default, the password property of newly created stacks is set to empty.
Â 
If the <password> <property> of a <stack> is not empty, all the text in the <stack> is <encrypt|encrypted> (so that it cannot be read in another program, such as a text editor). <script|Scripts>, <custom property|custom properties>, text in <field|fields> or <button|buttons>, and <object> names in a password-protected <stack> are all <encrypt|encrypted>. However, you can still open the <stack>, see the contents, and get <object> <property|properties>.

&nbsp;

The <password> <property> applies to a <stack>, not to the entire <stack file>, so it is possible to have a <stack file> that contains both password-protected and unprotected <stacks>. After setting the password the password protection does not take effect until the stack has been removed from memory and reloaded.

&nbsp;

If the <password> is set, the <stack|stack's> <script|Scripts> cannot be modified, its <password> cannot be changed, and <object|objects> cannot be copied.

&nbsp;

These restrictions stop operating temporarily for the current session when the stack's <passKey> <property> is set to the correct <password> by a <handler>.

&nbsp;

To permanently remove the password restrictions, set the stack's <password> to empty.

Setting the <password> to empty removes the <password> from the <stack> and makes it fully accessible to any user.

&nbsp;

>*Note:* Since all the text in a password-protected <stack> must be <decrypt|decrypted> when the <stack> is opened, a password-protected <stack> takes longer to open than an unencrypted one, especially if the <stack> is large.

&nbsp;

The password is encrypted when stored in the stack to prevent cracking the password protection. If you get the <password> of a <stack>, the <property> reports true if the stack has a password set and false otherwise.

&nbsp;

>*Important:* <password> -protected <stacks> may cause some problems when opened in the LiveCode <development environment>. (For example, the <Application Browser> window cannot display properties of a <password> -protected <stack>.) If you want to set a <password> for <stacks> before you release them, the recommended method is to set the <password> on the Stacks screen of the <Standalone Application Settings> window.
