Name: patterns

Type: property

Syntax: set the patterns of <object> to <patternsList> 

Summary: Specifies all the patterns of an <object>, in shorthand form.

Associations: stack,card,field,button,graphic,scrollbar,player,image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the patterns of button 1 to the patterns of card "Template"

Example:
set the patterns of me to storedPatternsList

Value:
The <patterns> of an <object> is a list of pattern specifiers, one per <line>.  A pattern specifier is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164 (corresponding to LiveCode's built-in patterns 136 to 300), or the <ID> of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in other open <stacks>.
The <patterns> of an <object> contains eight <lines>, some of which may be empty.

Description:
Use the <patterns> <property> to get all eight basic pattern <properties> at once, or to set the patterns of one <object> to be the same as the patterns of another <object>.

You can set all these patterns individually; the <patterns> <property> simply provides a shorter method of dealing with all of them at once. Each <line> of the <patterns> corresponds to one of the following pattern <properties> :

        * Line 1: the foregroundPattern
        * Line 2: the <backgroundPattern> 
        * Line 3: the hilitePattern
        * Line 4: the <borderPattern> 
        * Line 5: the topPattern
        * Line 6: the <bottomPattern> 
        * Line 7: the shadowPattern
        * Line 8: the focusPattern

If you leave a line blank when setting the <patterns>, the pattern <property> corresponding to that <line> is left unchanged.

If the <patterns> <property> of an <object> reports a blank <line>, the corresponding pattern is not set for the individual <object>, but is <inheritance|inherited> from the <object|object's> <owner>. Use the form the effective patterns of <object> to obtain the patterns used for the object, whether set for the <object> or <inheritance|inherited>.

If a pattern is set for an object, that pattern is used instead of the corresponding color for that object.
