Name: pointerFocus

Type: property

Syntax: set the pointerFocus to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether typed text is sent to the window under the 
<mouse pointer> or to the frontmost window.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
set the pointerFocus to true

Value (bool):
The <pointerFocus> is true or false.
By default, the <pointerFocus> <property> is set to true on <Mac OS>,
<OS X>, and <Windows|Windows systems>, and to false on <Unix|Unix
systems> that ship with <Motif>.

Description:
Use the <pointerFocus> <property> to determine how the <active window>
is determined.

On Unix systems, if the <pointerFocus> <property> is false, clicking
inside a window makes it the <active window>. This is the recommended
setup. 

If the <pointerFocus> <property> is true, moving the <mouse pointer>
into a window makes it the <active window>. Set the <pointerFocus> to
true to work around problems in some <Unix> window managers
(specifically, "olwm" and "fvwm" ) that prevent <explicit
focus|active-focus> applications such as LiveCode from operating
correctly. 

If the application is started from a Unix command line, this property
can be set to true on startup by using the -pointerfocus option.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS>, <OS X>, and 
> <Windows|Windows systems>, setting the <pointerFocus> <property> 
> to false changes  window activation in minor ways which are not 
> particularly useful, and has no other effect.
