(The relativePoints property is the same list, but measured from the top left of the graphic rather than the top left of the stack window.)<p></p><p>The first line in the list is the location of the graphic's starting point. A line is drawn from the starting point to the next vertex, which is the next line in the list. If two successive lines are identical, a dot is drawn at the specified point.</p><p></p><p>A blank line in the points indicates that the previous and next vertexes are not connected by a line--that is, the line, curve, or polygon is broken into two (or more) pieces. If the last line of the points of a polygon is blank, the polygon is not closed. A closed polygon's start point (the first line of its points property) is the same as its end point (the last line of its points property).</p><p></p><p></p><tip> When setting the points property, you can separate the individual points with a comma instead of a return. The points property is always reported with the points on separate lines, however.</tip><p></p><p>If the style property of the graphic is not "line", "polygon" or "curve", the setting of its points property has no effect.</p><p></p><p></p><note> The rectangle of a graphic is drawn around all its points without touching them. (Usually, this makes no difference, but in some circumstances where you need to place a graphic's vertex precisely with respect to another object's rectangle, you may need to take this into account.)</note><p></p><p></p><change><p>6.7: The effective points and effective relativePoints of a graphic return a polygonal representation of the shape even for shapes not defined by points. In particular, you can get the effective points of rectangle, round-rectangle and regular polygon graphics. (ovals are not yet supported).</change></comments>	</description></doc>
