Introduced: 1.0

Example:
set the printRotated to true

Value (bool):The <printRotated> is true or false.
By default, the <printRotated> <property> is set to false.

Description:
The <printRotated> property is deprecated as of version 2.9.  Setting the printRotated to true is equivalent to setting the printPaperOrientation to "landscape".  New applications should use printPaperOrientation in preference to printRotated.

The <printRotated> <property> was used to print wide pages.

If the <printRotated> <property> is set to false, printing is done in <portrait|portrait mode>--the short sides of the paper are the top and bottom of the printed page.

If the <printRotated> is true, the direction of the printed output is rotated 90 <degree|degrees>, so the long sides of the paper are the top and bottom.
