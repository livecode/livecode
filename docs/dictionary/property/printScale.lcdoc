The <printScale> specifies the ratio between the number of <pixels> in the <card(keyword)> and the number of <points> on the printed page. A <ratio> of 1 means the printed and screen <card(keyword)> should be the same size, if the screen's resolution is 72 <pixels> per inch.

For example, if a card is 360 pixels wide and you want its printed image to be 4 inches (288 points) across, set the <printScale> to 0.8 (288 pixels divided by 360 points).
