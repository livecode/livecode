Name: printTextStyle

Type: property

Syntax: set the printTextStyle to {plain | <stylesList>}

Summary:
Has no effect and is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with
imported <HyperCard> stacks.

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop, server

Security: printing

Description:
In HyperCard, the <printTextStyle> <property> specifies the styles of
printed text. In LiveCode, only <card(object)|cards> can be printed, and
the style of text on the <card(keyword)> is determined by the
<textStyle> <property> of <object|objects> that display text.

By default, the value of <printTextStyle> is plain. A handler can set
the <property>, but the new setting has no effect.
