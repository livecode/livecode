Name: privateColors

Type: property

Syntax: set the privateColors to true

Summary: Specifies whether LiveCode uses its own <color table> or the system <color table> on <Unix|Unix systems>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the privateColors to true

Value (bool):The <privateColors> is true or false.
By default, the <privateColors> <property> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <privateColors> <property> to improve display on <Unix|Unix systems> when the <bit depth> of the screen is 8 <bit|bits> (256 colors) or less.

Set the <privateColors> <property> to true for a <stack> that uses colors that aren't in the <default> <color table>. This has the advantage of letting the <stack> display more colors than normally possible on an 8- <bit> display. The disadvantage is that if the <privateColors> is true, the colors of other applications' windows may be distorted while LiveCode is the foreground application.

When the <privateColors> is set to false, the <engine> uses the system <color table>. When it is set to true, the <engine> uses its own custom <color table>.

This property has no effect unless the <screenType> <property> has a value of "PseudoColor"--that is, each <pixel> on the screen is one of a <color table> of colors (usually 256 colors), and the colors in that <color table> can be changed by the <engine>.

>*Important:*  Once the <privateColors> <property> is set to true, it cannot be set back to false. To change it back to true, you must quit and restart the <application>.

The setting of this property has no effect on Mac OS or Windows systems.
