Name: qtIdleRate

Type: property

Syntax: set the qtIdleRate to <number> 

Syntax: get the qtIdleRate

Summary: The global property <qtIdleRate> specifies how frequently to idle QuickTime movies.

Introduced: 2.7

OS: mac,windows

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the qtIdleRate to 50

Example:
put the qtIdleRate into tQtIdleRate

Value: The <qtIdleRate> is an integer between 1 and 65535.

Description:
Use the <qtIdleRate> in conjunction with the global <idleRate property> to control updating of QT movies. Increasing the <qtIdleRate> causes less frequent updates, and decreases the amount of CPU time the application uses.

By default, the qtIdleRate property is set to 50 (one-twentieth of a second).

The <qtIdleRate> is the time in milliseconds between one update of a player and the next.

Updating gives the player object time to redraw the video or other media being played. A higher idle rate will result in smoother playback but will also require more cpu time. 

LiveCode uses the following heuristics to determine how frequently to idle QT players:

If the version of QT &lt; 6 then it idles at the <qtIdleRate> at all times.

If the version of QT &gt;=6 then:
        * If no players are playing and none of the visible players have interactive movies assigned they are idled at the qtIdleRate.
        * If no players are playing, but one of more of the visible players are interactive then they are idled at the qtIdleRate.
        * If players are playing then they are idled at the <qtIdleRate>.
  
Interactive movies are ones such as QTVR and Flash that need to periodically check for input and update themselves.

>*Note:* The <qtIdleRate> property has no effect on Windows if the <dontUseQT property> is true.
