Summary: provides low-level access to the contents of the <drag-and-drop clipboard>.

Introduced: 8.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
put the keys of the rawDragData

Example:
set the rawDragData["text/plain;charset=utf-8"] to textEncode("Hello, World!", "UTF-8") -- Linux
set the rawDragData["CF_UNICODE"] to textEncode("Hello, World!", "UTF-16") -- Windows
set the rawDragData["public.utf8-plain-text"] to textEncode("Hello, World!", "UTF-8") -- OSX

Value:
The <rawDragData> pseudo-array provides low-level access to the data on the drag-and-drop clipboard. It can be accessed at any time but may be erased when another program begins a drag-and-drop operation.
The keys for the <rawDragData> are platform-specific.

Description:
Use the <rawClipboardData> to gain low-level access to the system drag-and-drop clipboard.. 

This property should only be used if you require low-level access; the <fullDragData> is more appropriate for most uses.

As a low-level feature, platform differences are not hidden. In particular, the form of the keys of the <rawClipboardData> are platform-specific, but can be summarised as:
 - Windows: arbitrary strings but keys of the form CF_xxx correspond to the clipboard formats defined by Windows itself
 - OSX: Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs) with an extension: OSTypes/MIME-types can be used by prefixing the key with com.apple.ostype:/public.mime-type:
 - Linux: arbitrary strings (X11 atoms) but, by convention, MIME types are used

>*Tip:*		All contents of the <rawDragData> are binary - use the <textEncode>/<textDecode> functions to convert to/from the appropriate encoding.
