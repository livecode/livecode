Value: The <recentCards> is a list of long <ID> properties of <card|cards>, one <ID> per <line>. If a <stack> is specified, the list contains only the <recent cards> in the specified <stack>. If not, all <recent cards> are listed.

Description:
Use the <recentCards> <property> to find out which <card(object)|cards> the user has visited, or to re-visit a <card(keyword)>.

The <recentCards> are listed in reverse order, with the <current card> at the top of the list, the most <recent cards|recently visited card> next, and so on. Each visit to a <card(keyword)> causes its <ID> to be placed at the top of the list, even if the same <card(keyword)> appears elsewhere in the list. The <recentCards> thus provides a complete track of the visitor's navigation.

Cards visited while the lockRecent <property> is set to true are not added to the list.
