Name: recordFormat

Type: property

Syntax: set the recordFormat to <fileFormat>

Summary:
Specifies the file <format> for sound files recorded with the <record
sound> <command>.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac

Platforms: desktop

Example:
set the recordFormat to "wave"

Example:
set the recordFormat to the storedSoundFormat of me

The result:
>*Important:*  If the <recordFormat> is set to "movie", the resulting
> <file> is in the <QuickTime> file format. <QuickTime> files cannot be
> played as <audio clip|audio clips>. To play such a sound, either
> create a <player> and set its <filename> <property> to the <file
> path|path> of the <file> you recorded, or use the play videoclip form
> of the <play> <command>.

Value (enum):

-   aiff: records a file in AIFF format (default)
-   wave: records a file in WAV format
-   ulaw: records a file in AU format
-   movie: records a file in QuickTime format


Description:
Use the <recordFormat> <property> to specify what kind of file to create
when recording a sound, depending on how the file will be used.

The <recordFormat> <property> determines what kind of file is created
when you use the <record sound> <command> to record sound.

Not all sound file formats are compatible with all supported codecs. If
you try to record sound using a recordCompressionType that is not
compatible with the <recordFormat>, the <compress|compression> type will
be changed automatically to a <codec> that is compatible with the
specified <recordFormat>.

Changes:
The use of <QuickTime> was deprecated in version 8.1 of LiveCode with
new defaults for <dontUseQT> and <dontUseQTEffects> as true on all
systems apart from pre OS X 10.8. The Windows build of LiveCode no
longer supports any <QuickTime> features and setting the <dontUseQT> and
<dontUseQTEffects> will have no effect. Additionally <QuickTime> does 
not include 64 bit support and therefore can not be supported on OS X 64
bit builds of LiveCode.
