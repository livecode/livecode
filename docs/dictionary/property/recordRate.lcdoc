Name: recordRate

Type: property

Syntax: set the recordRate to <kSamplesPerSecond> 

Summary: Specifies how often the sound input should be read during sound recording.

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the recordRate to 48 -- sample at 48 kHz

Value:
The <recordRate> is a non-negative number.
By default, the <recordRate> <property> is 22.05.

The result: The <kSamplesPerSecond> is the number of thousands of times per second the sound is sampled. The higher this number, the higher the quality of the resulting sound, and the larger the resulting <file>. For best sound quality, the higher recordRates should be used when the sound input is of high quality--for example, when recording from a CD--and when music is being recorded. (44.1 kHz is "CD-quality".) In general, you can use lower recordRates for spoken words than for music without compromising sound quality.

Description:
Use the <recordRate> <property> to trade off between sound quality and disk space when you record a sound.

The <recordRate> <property> determines the sound sampling rate when you use the <record sound> <command> to record sound to a file.

The possible recordRates depend on the system's capabilities.

>*Note:* The <answer record> <command> sets the <recordRate> <property> according to what the user chose in the <answer record> <dialog box>.
