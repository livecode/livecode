Value: The <rectangle> of an <object> consists of four <integer|integers> separated by commas.

Description:
Use the <rectangle> <property> to find out how far an <object> extends, to move it, or to resize it.

The four items of an object's <rectangle> describe the <object|object's> left, top, right, and bottom edges:

* The <left> is the number of <pixels> between the left edge of the <stack window> and the leftmost pixel of the <object>.

* The <top> is the number of <pixels> between the top edge of the <stack window> and the topmost pixel of the <object>.

* The <right> is the horizontal distance in <pixels> between the left edge of the <stack window> and the rightmost pixel of the <object>.

* The <bottom> is the vertical distance in <pixels> between the top edge of the <stack window> and the bottommost pixel of the <object>.

>*Note:* The sides of an <object|object's> <rectangle> specify the lines between <pixels>, not the <pixels> themselves. For example, if an <object|object's> <rectangle> is "0,0,2,2", the <object> includes four <pixels>, starting at the top left corner of the <card>. In the case of a line or curve <graphic(keyword)>, the <graphic(object)|graphic's> <rectangle> encloses all the <pixels> in the <graphic(object)|graphic's> <points> <property> without touching any of them.

If the object is a stack, its <rectangle> is relative to the left and top of the screen, rather than the left and top of the <stack window>.

The first two items of a card's <rectangle> are always zero. The third <item> is the <height> of the <card>, and the fourth is the <width> of the <card>.

>*Note:* The <rectangle> of a <graphic(keyword)> is drawn around all its <points> without touching them. (Usually, this makes no difference, but in some circumstances where you need to place a <graphic(object)|graphic's> <vertex> precisely with respect to another <object|object's> <rectangle>, you may need to take this into account.)

If you specify the effective <keyword>, the rectangle includes the outline added by the <showFocusBorder> <property>. It also includes the heavy outline added to the <defaultButton>. If the <showFocusBorder> of the <object> is false, or the <object> is not currently <focus|focused>, the effective rectangle is the same as the rectangle.

>*Note:*As of version 6.0 the effective rect property of stacks returns the rect of the given stack with its decorations and
frame taken into account. The effective rect of a stack can also be set. Here, the rect of the frame of the stack will be set appropriately before setting the rect of the stack.

Changes:
The use of the effective keyword with the rectangle property was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the rectangle of the defaultButton included the heavy outline.
