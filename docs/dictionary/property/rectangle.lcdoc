Name: rectangle

Synonyms: rect

Type: property

Syntax: set the rectangle of <object> to <left>, <top>, <right>, <bottom>

Syntax: get the [effective] rectangle of <object>

Summary:
Specifies the area within which an <object(glossary)> is drawn.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the rectangle of button "Tangle" to 20,20,45,200

Example:
set the rectangle of group 1 to the rectangle of this card

Value:
The <rectangle> of an <object(glossary)> consists of four
<integer|integers> separated by commas.

Description:
Use the <rectangle> <property> to find out how far an
<object(glossary)> extends, to move it, or to resize it.

The four items of an object's <rectangle> describe the
<object|object's> left, top, right, and bottom edges:

* The <left> is the number of <pixels> between the left edge of the 

<stack window> and the leftmost pixel of the <object(glossary)>.

* The <top> is the number of <pixels> between the top edge of the 

<stack window> and the topmost pixel of the <object(glossary)>.

* The <right> is the horizontal distance in <pixels> between the left 

edge of the <stack window> and the rightmost pixel of the 
<object(glossary)>.

* The <bottom> is the vertical distance in <pixels> between the top
  edge of the <stack window> and the bottommost pixel of the 

<object(glossary)>.

>*Note:* The sides of an <object|object's> <rectangle> specify the
> lines 
> between <pixels>, not the <pixels> themselves. For example, if an 
> <object|object's> <rectangle> is "0,0,2,2", the <object(glossary)> 
> includes four <pixels>, starting at the top left corner of the
> <card>. 
> In the case of a line or curve <graphic(keyword)>, the 
> <graphic(object)|graphic's> <rectangle> encloses all the <pixels> in 
> the <graphic(object)|graphic's> <points> <property> without touching 
> any of them.

If the object is a stack, its <rectangle> is relative to the left and 
top of the screen, rather than the left and top of the <stack window>.

The first two items of a card's <rectangle> are always zero. The third 
<item> is the <height> of the <card>, and the fourth is the <width> of 
the <card>.

>*Note:* The <rectangle> of a <graphic(keyword)> is drawn around all
> its 
> <points> without touching them. (Usually, this makes no difference, 
> but in some circumstances where you need to place a 
> <graphic(object)|graphic's> <vertex> precisely with respect to
> another 
> <object|object's> <rectangle>, you may need to take this into 
> account.)

If you specify the effective <keyword>, the rectangle includes the 
outline added by the <showFocusBorder> <property>. It also includes the 
heavy outline added to the <defaultButton>. If the <showFocusBorder> of 
the <object(glossary)> is false, or the <object(glossary)> is not 
currently <focus|focused>, the effective rectangle is the same as the 
rectangle.

>*Note:*As of version 6.0 the effective rect property of stacks returns 
> the rect of the given stack with its decorations and frame taken into 
> account. The effective rect of a stack can also be set. Here, the
> rect 
> of the frame of the stack will be set appropriately before setting
> the 
> rect of the stack.

Changes:
The use of the effective keyword with the rectangle property was 
introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the rectangle of the 
defaultButton included the heavy outline.
