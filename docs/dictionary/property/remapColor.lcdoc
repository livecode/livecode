Summary: Has no effect and is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with imported <SuperCard> projects.

Description:
In SuperCard, the <remapColor> <property> determines the behavior of <object|objects> when a <color table> is assigned to a <card> or <stack>. In LiveCode, <color table|color tables> are not assigned to <object|objects>, and this <property> has no effect.

The <remapColor> <property> is always set to true. A <handler> can set it to any <value> without causing a <error|script error>, but the actual <value> is not changed.
