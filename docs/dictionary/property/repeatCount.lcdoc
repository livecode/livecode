Value: The <repeatCount> of an <image> is an <integer>.

Description:
Use the <repeatCount> <property> to specify how many times an <animated GIF> <image> should repeat when it's displayed, or to stop it from repeating.

If the <repeatCount> is positive, the <image> repeats the specified number of times. If the <repeatCount> is <negative>, the <image> continues repeating indefinitely while it is being displayed.

If the <repeatCount> is zero, the <image> does not repeat at all. If you set the <repeatCount> of an <animated GIF> <image> to zero while it is playing, it stops repeating immediately.

If the contents of the image is not an animated GIF, the setting of the <repeatCount> <property> has no effect.
