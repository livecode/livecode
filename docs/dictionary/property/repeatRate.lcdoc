If the user clicks in the gray region of a scrollbar or on one of its arrows and holds the mouse button down, the scroll action is repeated and the scrollbar is updated repeatedly as long as the mouse is down. The <repeatRate> is the time in <milliseconds> between one update and the next.

If the <repeatRate> is zero, updates are performed as often as possible with no delay.

If the <repeatRate> is <negative>, scrollbar clicks do not repeat at all.
