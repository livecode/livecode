Name: revProfile

Synonyms: crevgeneral[&quot;profile&quot;], profile

Type: property

Syntax: set the revProfile of <object> to <profileName>

Summary:
Specifies the current <property profile|profile> for an
<object(glossary)>. 

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
set the revProfile of button "OK" to "French"

Example:
set the revProfile of group "Menubar" to "Short Menus"

Example:
set the revProfile of me to "Master"

Value (enum):
The <revProfile> of an object is the name of one of the object's
<property profile|profiles>


Description:
Use the <revProfile> <property> to switch sets of property values on the
fly. 

When you change the value of a property for an object, the value is
stored in the object's current profile. If you later switch back to that
profile, the stored values are restored. For example, if you create a
profile named "Fluffy" for a button, then set the button's
backgroundColor <property> to "pink", that setting of the
<backgroundColor> <property> is stored with the Fluffy <property
profile|profile>. If you later set the <button|button's> <property
profile|profile> to "Fluffy", the pink color is restored.

If the <profileName> does not exist for the <object(glossary)>, setting
the <property profile|profile> either causes an error or creates a new
<property profile|profile> with that name for the <object(glossary)>.
You change this setting in the "Property Profiles" pane of the
Preferences window.

(The <revProfile> <property> is implemented as a <custom property>, part
of the "cRevGeneral" <custom property> set. For this reason, you can
also refer to it using the <custom property> set notation, as
cRevGeneral["profile"].) 

>*Important:*  The <revProfile> property is part of the Profile library.
> To ensure that the property works in a standalone application, in the
> Profiles section on the General screen of the Standalone Application
> Settings window, make sure you choose to include profiles in your
> application. 

>*Note:* When included in a standalone application, the Profile library
> is implemented as a hidden group and made available when the group
> receives its first openBackground message. During the first part of
> the applicati startup process, before this message is sent, the
> <revProfile> property is not yet available. This may affect attempts
> to use this property in startup, preOpenStack, openStack, or
> preOpenCard hand in the main stack. Once the application has finished
> starting up, the library is available and the <revProfile> property
> can be used in any handler.
