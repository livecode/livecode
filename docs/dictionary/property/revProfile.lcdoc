Value (enum):
The <revProfile> of an object is the name of one of the object's
<property profile|profiles>


Description:
Use the <revProfile> <property> to switch sets of property values on the
fly. 

When you change the value of a property for an object, the value is
stored in the object's current profile. If you later switch back to that
profile, the stored values are restored. For example, if you create a
profile named "Fluffy" for a button, then set the button's
backgroundColor <property> to "pink", that setting of the
<backgroundColor> <property> is stored with the Fluffy
<property profile|profile>. If you later set the <button|button's>
<property profile|profile> to "Fluffy", the pink color is restored.

If the <profileName> does not exist for the <object(glossary)>, setting
the <property profile|profile> either fails silently or creates a new
<property profile|profile> with that name for the <object(glossary)>.
You change this setting using the <gRevAutoCreateProfiles> <variable>.

(The <revProfile> <property> is implemented as a <custom property>, part
of the "cRevGeneral" <custom property> set. For this reason, you can
also refer to it using the <custom property> set notation, as
cRevGeneral["profile"].) 

>*Important:*  The <revProfile> property is part of the Profile library.
> To ensure that the property works in a standalone application, in the
> Profiles section on the General screen of the Standalone Application
> Settings window, make sure you choose to include profiles in your
> application.
