Name: right

Type: property

Syntax: set the right of <object> to <pixels>

Summary:
Specifies how far an <object|object's> right edge is from the left edge
of the window or screen.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the right of last field to 22

Example:
set the right of me to item 1 of the clickLoc

Value:
The <right> of an <object(glossary)> is an integer. A <negative>
<integer> indicates that the position is to the left of the left edge of
the screen or <card> (and therefore cannot be seen). A stack's <right>
is the distance in <pixels> from the left edge of the screen to the
right edge of the <stack window>.

A card's or control's <right> is the distance in <pixels> from the left
edge of the <card> to the right edge of the <card> or <control>.

Description:
Use the <right> <property> to change the horizontal placement of a
<control> or window.

The <right> of a <stack> is in <absolute (screen)
coordinates(glossary)>. The <right> of a <card> is always the width of
the <stack window>; setting the <right> of a <card> does not cause a
<error|script error>, but it has no effect. The <right> of a <group> or
<control> is in <relative (window) coordinates(glossary)>.

Changing the <right> of an <object(glossary)> shifts it to the new
position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> width, set
its width or rectangle <property>.

The width <property> of an <object(glossary)> is equal to its <right>
minus its <left>.
