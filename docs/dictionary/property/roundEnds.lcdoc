Value (bool):The <roundEnds> of a <graphic> is true or false. 
By default, the <roundEnds> of a newly created <graphic> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <roundEnds> <property> to control the <appearance> of lines.

If the <roundEnds> of a <graphic> is true, the ends of lines are rounded, and so is the intersection of lines within the <graphic>. If the <roundEnds> is false, the ends of lines are squared off. 

If the graphic's <lineSize> <property> is 1, the setting of the <roundEnds> has no effect. 

If the graphic's <style> <property> is oval, roundRect, or curve, or if the graphic's <lineSize> <property> is less than 2, the setting of this <property> has no effect. 

The global setting of the <roundEnds> <property> <control|controls> the <appearance> of lines drawn with the <line>, <rectangle>, <polygon>, or <regular> <paint tool|paint tools>. Once a paint line or shape is drawn, its appearance cannot be changed by changing the <global> <roundEnds> <property>. 

The <roundEnds> property is derived from the <capStyle> property and returns true if, and only if, the <capStyle> property is round. Setting <roundEnds> to true sets the <capStyle> to round, and setting the <roundEnds> to false sets the <capStyle> to butt.

>*Cross-platform note:* The roundEnds property has no effect on Mac unless the graphic has its antialiased property set to true.
