Name: scaleFactor

Type: property

Syntax: set the scaleFactor of <stack> to <scale>

Summary:
Determines the custom scale factor for a stack.

Introduced: 6.6

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
-- scales the stack to half size
set the scaleFactor of stack "myLargeStack" to 0.5

Example:
-- Preview the stack appearance on a high-density display
set the scaleFactor of stack "myApp" to 1.5

Parameters:
stack:
A reference to a stack or an expression that evaluates to a stack.

scale:
A non-zero real number value which represents the scale multiplier.

Value:
The <scaleFactor> property returns a a non-zero real number or empty.

Description:
Use the <scaleFactor> property when developing to scale down stacks that
are larger than the available screen space.

We do not recommend setting the <scaleFactor> property above 2. The
higher the value, the more pixels must be rendered. For example, setting
the <scaleFactor> property to 10 will cause 100 times the number of
pixels to be rendered causing the IDE to run slowly.

> *Note:* The scaleFactor is not a persistent property of the stack when 
> building a standalone. To have scaleFactor applied to a standalone upon
> opening, it must be coded in a preOpenStack handler. For example:

    on preOpenStack
        set the scaleFactor of me to 0.75
    end preOpenStack
