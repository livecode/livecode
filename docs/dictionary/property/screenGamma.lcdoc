Name: screenGamma

Type: property

Syntax: set the screenGamma to <gammaValue> 

Summary: Specifies the <gamma> <value> used for displaying <PNG> <image|images>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the screenGamma to 2.2

Value: The <screenGamma> is a number.

Description:
Use the <screenGamma> <property> to control the color display of <PNG> <image(object)|images>.

PNG images can contain a preferred gamma setting. To display a PNG to best advantage, you may need to adjust the <screenGamma> <property> to match what the <PNG> expects.

Changes in the <screenGamma> do not apply to <PNG> <image(object)|images> that are already displayed. A <PNG> <image(keyword)> uses the <screenGamma> that was in effect when it was being decompressed for display.

>*Tip:*  To force LiveCode to re-decompress a <PNG> <image(keyword)> without leaving the <card>, put the <image(keyword)> into itself:

  set the screenGamma to 2.2
  put image "Test PNG" into image "Test PNG"
