Name: screenMouseLoc

Type: property

Syntax: set the screenMouseLoc to <horizontal>, <vertical>

Summary:
Specifies the position of the <mouse pointer> relative to the screen.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
put localLoc(the screenMouseLoc) into localMouse

Example:
set the screenMouseLoc to the topLeft of this stack

Value:
The <screenMouseLoc> consists of two <integer|integers>, separated by a
comma. It reports the position of the <mouse pointer> in <absolute
coordinates>--that is, relative to the top left of the main screen. (The
<mouseLoc> <function> is similar, but its coordinates are relative to
the <defaultStack> window rather than the screen.) If you set this
property, the mouse pointer is moved to the specified location on the
screen. 

Description:
Use the <screenMouseLoc> <property> to find out where the <mouse
pointer> is, or to change the location of the <mouse pointer>.

>*Important:*  Taking over the position of the <mouse pointer> can
> disorient and confuse users, and <user interface|user-interface>
> standards warn against doing so for that reason. Consider setting the
> <screenMouseLoc> <property> only in unusual situations (such as for a
> kiosk application or game). In normal desktop applications, the user
> expects a consistent <user interface> without such surprises. You must
> use this power only for good.

Changes:
Support for using the screenMouseLoc with OS X systems was added in
version 2.0.
