Description:
Use the <screenSharedMemory> <property> to improve drawing speed.

If the <screenSharedMemory> <property> is set to true, the <engine> uses the system's shared memory extension (if available) to draw <image(object)|images>. This speeds up <image(keyword)> rendering.

Shared memory is not available on all Unix systems, and cannot be used if the application is running across the network rather than locally.

If the application is started from a Unix command line, this property can be set to false on startup by using the -s option.

The setting of this property has no effect on Mac OS or Windows systems.
