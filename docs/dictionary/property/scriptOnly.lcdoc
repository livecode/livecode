Description:
A <scriptOnly> stack will save just the script with a single header line declaring the stack name. Any other objects or properties of the stack will not be written to disk.

The <scriptOnly> property has been added to enable scripts to detect and set the file format of the stack. Without this property it is not possible to detect the file format the stack is being saved in without examining the file itself.

>*Warning:* <scriptOnly> stacks only save the stack name and script. Any property changes and objects created while the stack is open will not exist the next time the stack is opened.
