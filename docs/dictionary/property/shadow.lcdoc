Name: shadow

Type: property

Syntax: set the shadow of <object> to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether a <button>, <field>, or stack window is drawn with a
drop shadow.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the shadow of field ID 18 to true

Example:
set the shadow of this stack to false

Value (bool):
The <shadow> of an <object(glossary)> is true or false.
By default, the <shadow> of a newly created <stack> is set to true. The
<shadow> of a newly created <control> is false by <default>, but may be
true if it is created by the <development environment>. (For example,
choosing Object menu &gt; New Control &gt; Shadow Button creates a
button whose <shadow> is true.).

Description:
Use the <shadow> <property> to draw a drop shadow.   

While the <shadow> <property> can be set for any <control(keyword)>, it
affects the appearance of only <field|fields> and <button|buttons>.
Other <control(object)|controls> do not display a drop shadow,
regardless of the setting of their <shadow> <property>.

The <shadow> of a <stack window> is drawn by the operating system. On
<Mac OS>, <Unix>, and <Windows|Windows systems>, the setting of a
<stack|stack's> <shadow> <property> has no effect.

The setting of this property for a stack affects the stack's decorations
property, and vice versa. Setting a stack's <shadow> property determines
whether its decorations property includes "noShadow" (or is "default",
for window styles that normally include a drop shadow). Conversely,
setting a stack's decorations property sets its <shadow> to true or
false depending on whether the decorations includes "noShadow" (or is
"default" ).

By default, the shadow extends 4 <pixels> to the left and below the
<object(glossary)>. You can change the size and direction of the drop
shadow with the <shadowOffset> <property>. (The <shadowOffset> has no
effect on <stack window|stack windows>.)

Changes:
The ability to specify the <shadow> of a <stack> was added in version 2.
