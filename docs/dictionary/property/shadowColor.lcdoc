Value:
The <shadowColor> of an <object(glossary)> is a <color reference>.
The <colorName> is any standard color name.

The <RGBColor> consists of three comma-separated <integer|integers>
between zero and 255, specifying the level of each of red, green, and
blue; or an HTML-style color consisting of a hash mark (#) followed by
three <hexadecimal> numbers, one for each of red, green, and blue.

By default, the <shadowColor> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Use the <shadowColor> <property> to specify the drop shadow color of a
<field(keyword)> or button or the background color of a <scrollbar>.

Setting the <shadowColor> of an <object(glossary)> to empty allows the
<shadowColor> of the <object|object's> owner to show through. Use the
<effective> <keyword> to find out what color is used for the
<object(glossary)>, even if its own <shadowColor> is empty.

The setting of the <shadowColor> <property> has different effects,
depending on the <object type>:

* The <shadowColor> of a <stack>, <card>, or <group> determines the
  <shadowColor> of each <object(glossary)> in the <stack>, <card>, or
  <group> that does not have its own <shadowColor>.


* The <shadowColor> of a <button(keyword)> is used for the
  <button(object)|button's> drop shadow. If the
  <button(object)|button's> <style> is menu (unless the menuMode is
  tabbed), the <shadowColor> has no effect. If the <button(keyword)> is
  a <tabbed button>, the <shadowColor> is always used for the inactive
  tabs; otherwise, if the <button(object)|button's> <shadow> <property>
  is false, the <shadowColor> has no effect.


* The <shadowColor> of a <field(keyword)> determines the color of the
  <field(object)|field's> drop shadow. If the <field(object)|field's>
  <shadow> <property> is false, the <shadowColor> has no effect.


* The <shadowColor> of a <scrollbar> determines the background color of
  the <scrollbar>.


* The <shadowColor> of a <graphic>, <player>, <audio clip>, <video
  clip>, or <EPS|EPS object> has no effect.


* The <shadowColor> of an <image(keyword)> is the seventh color in the
  <image(object)|image's> <color palette>.


If an object's shadowPattern is set, the pattern is shown instead of the
color specified by the <shadowColor>.
