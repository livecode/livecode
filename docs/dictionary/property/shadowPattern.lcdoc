Name: shadowPattern

Type: property

Syntax: set the shadowPattern of <object> to {<patternNumber> | <imageID> | empty}

Summary: Specifies the pattern of an <object|object's> drop shadow.

Associations: stack,card,field,button,graphic,scrollbar,player,image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the shadowPattern of next card to empty

Example:
set the shadowPattern of last button to 409

Value:
The <shadowPattern> of an <object> is a pattern specifier.
A <patternNumber> is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164. (These patterns correspond to LiveCode's built-in patterns 136 to 300.)

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in other open <stacks>.

By default, the <shadowPattern> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Use the <shadowPattern> <property> to specify the drop shadow pattern of a <field(keyword)> or <button(keyword)> or the background pattern of a <scrollbar>.

Pattern images can be color or black-and-white.

>*Cross-platform note:*  To be used as a pattern on <Mac OS|Mac OS systems>, an <image> must be 128x128 <pixels> or less, and both its <height> and <width> must be a power of 2. To be used on <Windows> and <Unix|Unix systems>, <height> and <width> must be divisible by 8. To be used as a fully cross-platform pattern, both an image's dimensions should be one of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.

The <shadowPattern> of <control(object)|controls> is drawn starting at the <control(object)|control's> upper right corner: if the <control(keyword)> is moved, the pattern does not shift.

Setting the <shadowPattern> of an <object> to empty allows the <shadowPattern> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show through. Use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what color is used for the <object>, even if its own <shadowPattern> is empty.

The setting of the <shadowPattern> <property> has different effects, depending on the <object type>:

* The <shadowPattern> of a <stack>, <card>, or <group> determines the <shadowPattern> of each <object> in the <stack>, <card>, or <group> that does not have its own <shadowPattern>.

* The <shadowPattern> of a <button(keyword)> is used for the <button(object)|button's> drop shadow. If the <button(object)|button's> <style> is menu (unless the menuMode is tabbed), the <shadowPattern> has no effect. If the <button(keyword)> is a <tabbed button>, the <shadowPattern> is always used for the inactive tabs; otherwise, if the <button(object)|button's> <shadow> <property> is false, the <shadowPattern> has no effect.

* The <shadowPattern> of a <field(keyword)> determines the pattern used for the <field(object)|field's> drop shadow. If the <field(object)|field's> <shadow> <property> is false, the <shadowPattern> has no effect.

* The <shadowPattern> of a <scrollbar> determines the background pattern of the <scrollbar>.

* The <shadowPattern> of a <graphic>, <image>, <player>, <audio clip>, <video clip>, or <EPS|EPS object> has no effect.

If an object's <shadowPattern> is set, the pattern is shown instead of the color specified by the <shadowColor>.
