Value (bool):The <sharedHilite> of a <button(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <sharedHilite> of newly created <button(object)|buttons> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <sharedHilite> <property> to cause a <button(keyword)> (such as a <radio button> or <checkbox>) to display the same state wherever it is shown.

If a button's <sharedHilite> <property> is set to true, the <hilite> <property> of that <button(keyword)> is the same on all <card(object)|cards> where the <button(keyword)> appears. <highlight|Highlighting> the button on one <card(keyword)> <highlight|highlights> it on all of them. If the <button(object)|button's> <sharedHilite> is false, it can have a different <hilite> <property> on each <card(keyword)> where it appears, and <highlighting(glossary)> a button <highlight|highlights> it only on the <current card>.

Set the <sharedHilite> <property> to false for <radio button|radio buttons> and <checkbox|checkboxes> (and for other <button(object)|buttons> whose <hilite> is retained to display a setting or a state) if the state the <button(keyword)> displays is different for each <card(keyword)>.
