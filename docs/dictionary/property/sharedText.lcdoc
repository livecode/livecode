Name: sharedText

Type: property

Syntax: set the sharedText of <field> to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether a <grouped control|grouped field's> text is the same on all <card|cards> with that <group>.

Associations: field

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the sharedText of field "Section Marker" to true

Value (bool):The <sharedText> of a <field(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <sharedText> <property> of newly created <field(object)|fields> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <sharedText> <property> to create labels or other <field(object)|fields> with static text (the same on all <card(object)|cards> where the <field(keyword)> appears).

If a field's <sharedText> <property> is set to true, the content of that <field(keyword)> is the same on all <card(object)|cards> where the <field(keyword)> appears. Changing the text on one <card(keyword)> changes it on all the <card(object)|cards>.

If the field's <sharedText> is false, it can have different text on each <card(keyword)> where it appears, and changing the <field(object)|field's> text changes it only on the <current card>.

If the field is a card field (not part of a group), its <sharedText> <property> has no effect.
