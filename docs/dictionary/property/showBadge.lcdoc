Use the <showBadge> <property> to let users show or hide the <player(keyword)> <controller bar>.

Set the <showBadge> <property> to true if you are setting the <player(object)|player's> <showController> <property> to false, but want to display the <controller bar> if desired.

If the player's showController <property> is true, the setting of the <showBadge> <property> has no effect.
