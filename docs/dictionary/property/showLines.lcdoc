Example:
set the showLines of the target to true

Value (bool):The <showLines> of a <field(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <showLines> <property> of newly created <field(object)|fields> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <showLines> <property> to control the appearance of a <field>.

If a field's <showLines> <property> is true, a dotted horizontal line is drawn across the <field>, every lineHeight <pixels>. The line falls at the text baseline, so descenders (in letters like "p" and "g") extend into or below the line.

The dotted lines drawn by the <showLines> appear above the solid lines drawn by the <hGrid> <property>, and are drawn in the <foregroundColor> (or <foregroundPattern>).

If the field's <fixedLineHeight> <property> is set to false, the <showLines> <property> has no effect.

The line does not appear under text that is selected.
