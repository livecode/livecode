Name: slices

Type: property

Syntax: set the slices to <number> 

Summary: Specifies how many angles a <line> can snap to when drawing a <line> or irregular <polygon> with the Shift key held down.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the slices to 4 -- only 90-degree angles with shift key

Example:
set the slices to card field 2

Value:
The <slices> is an <integer> greater than 1.
By default, the <slices> <property> is 16.

Description:
Use the <slices> <property> to draw lines at specified angles.

The <slices> <property> is specified in <degree|degrees>. 360 (the number of <degree|degrees> in a full circle) divided by the <slices> yields the angle of each slice to the next slice. For example, if the <slices> is set to 16,  the angle of a line drawn with the Shift key held down can be any multiple of 22.5 <degree|degrees> (360 divided by 16).
