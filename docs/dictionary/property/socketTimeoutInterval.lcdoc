Name: socketTimeoutInterval

Type: property

Syntax: set the socketTimeoutInterval to <milliseconds> 

Summary: Specifies how long to wait for a <read from socket> or <write to socket> <command> to finish before <timeout|timing out>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,iOS,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the socketTimeoutInterval to 100 -- one-tenth of a second

Value:
The <socketTimeoutInterval> is a positive <integer>.
By default, the <socketTimeoutInterval> is 10000 (ten seconds).

Description:
Use the <socketTimeoutInterval> to specify a time to wait for <socket> actions to complete.

If the <socketTimeoutInterval> passes and no data has been transmitted yet, the <socketTimeout> <message> is sent to the <object> whose <script> contains the <read from socket> or <write to socket> <command>.

LiveCode checks the <socketTimeoutInterval> every time a <read from socket> or <write to socket> <command> is <execute|executed>, so you can specify different intervals for different <command|commands> by changing the <socketTimeoutInterval> before issuing the <command>.

As long as the action is still pending, the <socketTimeout> <message> is sent every time the <socketTimeoutInterval> elapses. For example, if the <socketTimeoutInterval> is 1000 <milliseconds> (one second), a <socketTimeout> <message> is sent every second until the action completes.
