Name: spray

Type: property

Syntax: set the spray to {<brushID> | <imageID>}

Summary:
Specifies the shape used for painting with the Spray Can <tool>.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
set the spray to 30

Value:
The <spray> is a brush specifier.
A <brushID> is a built-in brush number between 1 and 36. (These brushes
correspond to LiveCode's built-in patterns 101 to 136.)

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for painting with the spray
can. LiveCode looks for the specified <image> first in the <current
stack>, then in other open <stacks>.

By default, the <spray> is set to 34 (a round splatter pattern).

Description:
Use the <spray> <property> to specify which shape is painted by the
Spray Can <tool>.

The entire painted area of the brush is used as the spray can shape. The
shape painted by the spray can is drawn in the brushColor, regardless of
what colors might be in the <image> used for the spray can shape.

When the Spray Can tool is in use, the cursor is the same as the spray
can shape. You can use any size image as a spray can, but the cursor may
appear distorted on some systems if the image is not 16x16 pixels.
