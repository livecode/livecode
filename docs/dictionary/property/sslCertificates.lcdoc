Name: sslCertificates

Type: property

Syntax: set the sslCertificates to <certificatesList>

Syntax: get the sslCertificates

Summary:
Specifies a list of files and folders which are searched for SSL
certificates to authenticate secure socket connections.

Associations: ssl & encryption

Introduced: 2.5

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Security: network

Example:
set the sslCertificates to "/Users/guest/Certificates"

The result:
put the result & return & it.

Value:
The <sslCertificates> property is a list of files and folders, one per
line. By default, the <sslCertificates> property is empty.

Description:
Use the <sslCertificates> to determine the SSL certificate that secure
sockets should use to authenticate.

When a secure socket connection needs to authenticate it will look
through the <sslCertificates> line by line. If a line is a path to a
folder, each file in that folder will be searched for SSL certificates.
If a line is a file, that file will be searched for SSL certificates.

>*Important:* If you specify relative paths in the <sslCertificates>
> property they will be interpreted relative to the defaultFolder at the
> time a certificate is searched for.

>*Important:*  The <sslCertificates> <property> is part of the 
> <SSL & Encryption library>. To ensure that the <property> works in a 
> <standalone application>, you must include this

This uses the standard root certificate keychain on Mac, the standard
root certificate store on Windows and uses a number of heuristics to
locate this information on Linux.

You can easily find out if the system-installed root certificates are
being found by running the following command in the message box:

    get url "https://www.google.com"


If this results in an error about verification failure then it is likely
that root certificates have not been found. Please let us know
(particularly on Linux) if you find this simple test fails, making sure
you give us full details of your system (e.g. Linux distribution and
version). 

>*Note:* Unfortunately this feature does not currently work correctly on
> Mac 10.6.x. For now, we advise including an appropriate root
> certificates collection with your application, as was previously
> necessary, and setting the sslCertificates property appropriately.

Changes:
Before version 4.5 it was necessary to set the <sslCertificates>
property to the root certificates that HTTPS connections should be
verified against. Support has now been added to locate and load the root
certificates installed (and kept up to date) as part of the OS.
