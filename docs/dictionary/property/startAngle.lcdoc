Name: startAngle

Type: property

Syntax: set the startAngle [of <graphic>] to <angleInDegrees> 

Summary: Determines the <point> at which an arc begins.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the startAngle of graphic ID 673 to 90 -- top

Example:
set the startAngle to the startAngle + 12

Value:
The <startAngle> of a <graphic> is an <integer> between zero and 359.
By default, the <startAngle> <property> of a newly created <graphic> is zero.

Description:
Use the <startAngle> <property> to create an arc shape from an oval <graphic>, or to cause the Oval <paint tool> to draw arcs.

By default, ovals display their entire arc from zero to 360Â°, forming a complete oval. Use the <startAngle> and <arcAngle> <properties> to specify that only a portion of the oval, forming an arc, should be drawn.

The <startAngle> determines the starting <point> of the arc. The <angleInDegrees> zero is at the right edge, 3 o'clock. Increasing the <angleInDegrees> moves the starting <point> counter-clockwise around the arc.

The global setting of the <arcAngle> <property> <control|controls> the appearance of arcs drawn with the <paint tool|paint tools>. Once a paint arc is drawn, its appearance cannot be changed by changing the <global> <arcAngle> <property>.

For a graphic oval, the angle is the same as the <startAngle>. Changing one changes the other.
