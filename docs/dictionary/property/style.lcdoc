Description:
Use the <style> <property> to set an object's specific type.

The possible settings of an object's <style> <property> depend on the kind of <object>.

The <style> of a <button> is one of the following:
        * <standard> : the standard button for the current <lookAndFeel> setting
        * transparent: no border; name is displayed but background is transparent
        * <opaque> : <background> is the opaque <backgroundColor> of the button
        * rectangle: opaque rectangular or square <button> with a border
        * roundRect: opaque rectangular or square <button> with rounded corners
        * <shadow> : opaque rectangular or square <button> with a drop shadow
        * menu: a menu whose <appearance> is set by the <menuMode> property
        * checkbox: a <checkbox> option button
        * radioButton: a radio button

The <style> of a <button> interacts with certain other <properties>. For example, setting the <opaque> of a standard <button> to false sets its <style> to "transparent".

The <style> of a <field> is one of the following:
        * transparent: no border; text is displayed but background is transparent
        * <opaque> : <background> is the opaque <backgroundColor> of the field
        * rectangle: opaque <field> with a border
        * <shadow> : opaque <field> with a drop shadow
        * scrolling: opaque field with a vertical scrollbar

The <style> of a <graphic> determines its shape and is one of the following:
        * curve: a curved line
        * line: a straight line
        * oval: an oval or circle shape
        * polygon: an irregular polygon shape
        * rectangle: a rectangle or square shape
        * regular: a <regular polygon> shape
        * roundRect: a rectangle or square shape with rounded corners

The <style> of a <scrollbar> is one of the following:
        * scrollbar: a standard scrollbar
        * scale: a "bead on a wire" slider control
        * progress: a sliding progress bar display

Vertical scale and progress scrollbars always reflect the current lookAndFeel setting. Horizontal scale and progress <scrollbars> use the <Motif> look and feel, unless the <lookAndFeel> is set to "Appearance Manager".

The <style> of a <stack> determines its behavior and is one of the following:
        * topLevel: editable window
        * modeless: modeless dialog box, cannot be edited, can use only Browse tool
        * modal: modal dialog box, can use only Browse tool
        * palette: palette window, cannot be resized or edited, can use only Browse tool
