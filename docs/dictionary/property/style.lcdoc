Description:
Use the <style> <property> to set an object's specific type.

The possible settings of an object's <style> <property> depend on the 
kind of <object(glossary)>.

The <style> of a <button(object)> is one of the following:

* "standard" : the standard button for the current <lookAndFeel> setting
* "transparent": no border; name is displayed but background is
  transparent 
* "opaque" : <background> is the opaque <backgroundColor> of the button
* "rectangle": opaque rectangular or square <button(object)> with a
  border 
* "roundRect": opaque rectangular or square <button(object)> with
  rounded corners
* "shadow" : opaque rectangular or square <button(object)> with a drop
  shadow 
* "menu": a menu whose <appearance> is set by the <menuMode> property
* "checkbox": a <checkbox> option button
* "radioButton": a radio button


The <style> of a <button(object)> interacts with certain other 
<properties>. For example, setting the <opaque> of a standard 
<button(object)> to false sets its <style> to "transparent".

The <style> of a <field> is one of the following:

* "transparent": no border; text is displayed but background is
  transparent 
* "opaque" : <background> is the opaque <backgroundColor> of the field
* "rectangle": opaque <field> with a border
* "shadow" : opaque <field> with a drop shadow
* "scrolling": opaque field with a vertical scrollbar


The <style> of a <graphic> determines its shape and is one of the
following: 

* "curve": a curved line
* "line": a straight line
* "oval": an oval or circle shape
* "polygon": an irregular polygon shape
* "rectangle": a rectangle or square shape
* "regular": a <regular polygon> shape
* "roundRect": a rectangle or square shape with rounded corners


The <style> of a <scrollbar> is one of the following:

* "scrollbar": a standard scrollbar
* "scale": a "bead on a wire" slider control
* "progress": a sliding progress bar display


Vertical scale and progress scrollbars always reflect the current 
<lookAndFeel> setting. Horizontal scale and progress <scrollbars> use 
the <Motif> look and feel, unless the <lookAndFeel> is set to 
"Appearance Manager".

The <style> of a <stack> determines its behavior and is one of the
following: 

* "topLevel": editable window
* "modeless": modeless dialog box, cannot be edited, can use only Browse
  tool 
* "modal": modal dialog box, can use only Browse tool
* "palette": palette window, cannot be resized or edited, can use only
  Browse tool
