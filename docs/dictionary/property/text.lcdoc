Value: The <text> of a <field>, <button>, or <image> is a <string>.

Description:
Use the <text> <property> to work with the contents of a <field>, <button(keyword)>, or <image>.

Fields
The text of a field is simply the contents of the field. You can also use the <target> <keyword> to obtain the contents of a <field> :

    the text of the target is target
    -- evaluates to true if target is a field

The <text> of a field is always returned in the native encoding.

### Buttons

The <text> of a <button(keyword)> is used as the <button(object)|button's> <menu> contents. (A menu whose contents is the <text> of a <button(keyword)> is called a <button menu>. ) If the <button(object)|button's> <style> is not set to "menu", the setting of its <text> <property> has no effect. However, the <text> <property> can be used to store data in a <button(keyword)>, regardless of the <button(object)|button's> <style>; the text is not visible to the user unless the <button(keyword)> is a <button menu>.

See the <menu(keyword)> entry for more information about the format of menu item entries in the menu button text.

The <text> of a button is always returned in the native encoding.

### Images
The <text> of an image is the binary data that makes up the image. The following formats are supported:

####Fully Supported Formats

Setting the text to one of these formats displays the image as expected and sets the paintCompression to the correct type automatically. The data is also preserved meaning that getting the <text> returns the original data unchanged.
- GIF (All platforms)
- JPEG (All platforms)
- PNG (All platforms)
- WMF (Windows only - Windows Metafile)
- EMF (Windows only - Windows Enhanced Metafile)

#### Import Only Formats
There are also some formats that are not fully supported but can be imported. The image is converted to one of the supported formats, depending on the global <paintCompression property>.
- BMP (Windows bitmap)
- XWD (X Windows Dump format)
- XBM (X Windows Bitmap)
- XPM (X Windows Pixmap)
- PBM (NetPBM Portable Bitmap)
- PGM (NetPBM Portable Greyscale Map)
- PPM (NetPBM Portable Pixmap)

>*Note:*  Indeed, it is odd to be calling <binary file|binary data> the "text" <property>. The usage came about for historical reasons.

These two statements are equivalent:

    set the text of object tObjectId to tString
    put tString into object tObjectId

>*Tip:*  Instead of displaying a <button(object)|button's> text when using the <button(keyword)> as a menu, you can designate a <stack> to be displayed as the menu contents. This type of menu is called a <stack menu>. If the <button's (object)> <menuName> <property> is not empty, the <stack> specified by the <menuName> is used as the menu contents, instead of the <button's (object)>text <property>.
