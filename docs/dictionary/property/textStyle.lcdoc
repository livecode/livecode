Value: The <textStyle> of an <object> or <chunk> is either "plain", empty, "mixed", or one or more of the following, separated by commas:
        - bold
        - italic
        - underline
        - strikeout
        - <box> 
        - threeDbox
        - link (or group)

Description:
Use the <textStyle> <property> to change the appearance of text.

Setting the <textStyle> to "plain" turns off all styles. (Setting the <textStyle> to "plain" plus one or more additional styles may result in anomalous behavior.)

Setting the <textStyle> of an <object> to empty allows the <textStyle> of the <object|object's> <owner> to show through. Use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what style is used for the <object>, even if its own <textStyle> is empty. Similarly, use the <effective> <keyword> to find out what style is used for a <chunk> of text, even if the <chunk|chunk's> <textStyle> is empty.

If you request the <textStyle> of a <chunk> which includes multiple style runs--for example, some bold and some plain text--the <property> reports "mixed".

The "link" style can be used only for chunks of a field, not for objects. Setting the <textStyle> of a <chunk> to "link" turns it into a <grouped text|text group>.

the <textStyle> [&lt;style&gt;]

Here, style can be one of bold, condensed, expanded, italic, oblique, box, threedbox, underline, strikeout, link. For example

set the <textStyle> ["bold"] of field 1 to true

Changes:
The "link" style was introduced in version 1.1. In previous versions, the term "group" was used. The term "group" is still available as a partial synonym: setting the <textStyle> of a <chunk> to "group" sets it to "link".

As of version 5.0.2 a new array variant of the <textStyle> property has been added allowing for access to individual textStyles independently from the others by specifying the required style as an array key.
