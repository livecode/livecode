Name: themeClass

Type: property

Syntax: set the themeClass of tObject to tThemeClass

Summary: Specifies which set of theming parameters should be used for an object.

Introduced: 8.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the themeClass of field "mylabel" to "label"

Value (string): The <themeClass> of an object or control is what kind of object to treat it as for UI theming purposes.

Description:
Use the <themeClass> property of an object or control to change which set of theming parameters it uses. These parameters include fonts, colors and sizes. For example, setting the <themeClass> of a field to "label" will cause it to use the fonts and colors of a label rather than a text entry box.

If no <themeClass> is specified, the engine will auto-detect the appropriate type based on the properties of the object. To retrieve this auto-detected type when the property is empty use <the effective themeClass>.

Unlike many other appearance-related properties, the <themeClass> property is not inherited.
