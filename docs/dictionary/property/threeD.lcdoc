Value (bool):An object's <threeD> <property> is true or false.
By default, the <threeD> <property> of newly created <object|objects> is true.

Description:
Use the <threeD> <property> to determine whether an <object> appears flat or three-dimensional.

If the <threeD> of an <object> is true, the <object> appears to stick up out of the screen (if it is a <button>) or be pressed a few <pixels> below the level of the screen. If the <threeD> is false, the <object> appears flat.

The borders of objects whose <threeD> is true are drawn with the <topColor> and bottomC to simulate depth. The borders of <object|objects> whose <threeD> is false are drawn with the <borderColor>.

If the object's borderWidth <property> is zero, or its <showBorder> is false, the <threeD> <property> has no effect.

You can set the <threeD> <property> of a <stack>, but the <property> has no effect.
