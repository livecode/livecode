Description:
Use the <thumbSize> <property> to specify the size of a <scrollbar|scrollbar's> draggable <scrollbar thumb|thumb>.

Normally, the <thumbSize> is proportional to the proportion of content visible on the screen. For example, if a third of the content can be seen and the rest is always scrolled off, the <scrollbar thumb> should cover a third of the scrollbar area, so the <number> should be one-third of the difference between the <scrollbar|scrollbar's> <startValue> and its <endValue>.

If the <proportionalThumbs> <property> is set to false, this <property> has no effect.
