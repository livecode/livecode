Type: property

Syntax: set the tilt of <player> to <degrees> 

Summary: Specifies the current vertical view angle of a <QuickTime VR> movie.

Associations: player

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Example:
set the tilt of player "Arctic" to -30
put (the tilt of me) / 2 into halfwayPoint

Value: The <tilt> is a number between -90 and 90.

Description:
Use the <tilt> <property> to find out where the user is in a <QuickTime VR> movie.

The user can move the view of a QuickTime VR movie using the navigational controls in the player; a handler can change the view by setting the player's <pan> and <tilt> <properties>.

The <tilt> specifies the amount of rotation in the vertical plane, in <degree|degrees>. (Think of a person standing in the middle of a scene and tilting his or her head up and down. The point where the person is standing is the <currentNode>, and the amount the person's head is tilted is the <tilt>.)

A <tilt> of zero corresponds to the default view of the scene, with the viewer looking straight ahead. As the viewer's head tilts up, the <tilt> increases: when the <tilt> is 90, the viewer is looking straight up. As the viewer's head tilts down, the <tilt> decreases: when the <tilt> is -90, the viewer is looking straight down.

The <tilt> is limited by the <player|player's> <constraints> <property>. If you specify a <tilt> greater than the <range> permitted by the <constraints>, the <tilt> is set to the highest permitted <value>. If you specify a <tilt> less than the <range> permitted by the <constraints>, the <tilt> is set to the lowest permitted <value>.

If the player does not contain a QuickTime VR movie, its <tilt> <property> is zero.
