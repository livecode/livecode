Name: tilt

Type: property

Syntax: set the tilt of <player> to <degrees>

Summary:
Specifies the current vertical view angle of a <QuickTime VR> movie.

Associations: player

Introduced: 1.0

Deprecated: 8.1

OS: mac, windows

Platforms: desktop, server

Example:
set the tilt of player "Arctic" to -30
put (the tilt of me) / 2 into halfwayPoint

Value:
The <tilt> is a number between -90 and 90.

Description:
Use the <tilt> <property> to find out where the user is in a <QuickTime
VR> movie.

The user can move the view of a QuickTime VR movie using the
navigational controls in the player; a handler can change the view by
setting the player's <pan> and <tilt> <properties>.

The <tilt> specifies the amount of rotation in the vertical plane, in
<degree|degrees>. (Think of a person standing in the middle of a scene
and tilting his or her head up and down. The point where the person is
standing is the <currentNode>, and the amount the person's head is
tilted is the <tilt>.)

A <tilt> of zero corresponds to the default view of the scene, with the
viewer looking straight ahead. As the viewer's head tilts up, the <tilt>
increases: when the <tilt> is 90, the viewer is looking straight up. As
the viewer's head tilts down, the <tilt> decreases: when the <tilt> is
-90, the viewer is looking straight down.

The <tilt> is limited by the <player|player's> <constraints> <property>.
If you specify a <tilt> greater than the <range> permitted by the
<constraints>, the <tilt> is set to the highest permitted <value>. If
you specify a <tilt> less than the <range> permitted by the
<constraints>, the <tilt> is set to the lowest permitted <value>.

If the player does not contain a QuickTime VR movie, its <tilt>
<property> is zero.

Changes:
This property was deprecated in version 8.1.0 due to the retirement of
the QuickTime player implementation. In order to support 64-bit on Mac 
we have been required to switch to using AVFoundation on Mac, which does 
not support QTVR. In addition, the Windows player object is now based on 
DirectShow, as Apple have dropped support for the QuickTime libraries 
previously used.
