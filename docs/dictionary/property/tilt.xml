    <p>Use the <b>tilt</b> <glossary tag="property">property</glossary> to find out where the user is in a <glossary tag="QuickTime VR">QuickTime VR</glossary> movie.</p><p/><p><b>Value:</b></p><p>The <b>tilt</b> is a number between -90 and 90.</p><p/><p><b>Comments:</b></p><p>The user can move the view of a QuickTime VR movie using the navigational controls in the player; a handler can change the view by setting the player's <b>pan</b> and <b>tilt</b> <property tag="properties">properties</property>.</p><p/><p>The <b>tilt</b> specifies the amount of rotation in the vertical plane, in <glossary tag="degree">degrees</glossary>. (Think of a person standing in the middle of a scene and tilting his or her head up and down. The point where the person is standing is the <property tag="currentNode">currentNode</property>, and the amount the person's head is tilted is the <b>tilt</b>.)</p><p/><p>A <b>tilt</b> of zero corresponds to the default view of the scene, with the viewer looking straight ahead. As the viewer's head tilts up, the <b>tilt</b> increases: when the <b>tilt</b> is 90, the viewer is looking straight up. As the viewer's head tilts down, the <b>tilt</b> decreases: when the <b>tilt</b> is -90, the viewer is looking straight down.</p><p/><p>The <b>tilt</b> is limited by the <glossary tag="player">player's</glossary> <property tag="constraints">constraints</property> <glossary tag="property">property</glossary>. If you specify a <b>tilt</b> greater than the <glossary tag="range">range</glossary> permitted by the <property tag="constraints">constraints</property>, the <b>tilt</b> is set to the highest permitted <function tag="value">value</function>. If you specify a <b>tilt</b> less than the <glossary tag="range">range</glossary> permitted by the <property tag="constraints">constraints</property>, the <b>tilt</b> is set to the lowest permitted <function tag="value">value</function>.</p><p/><p>If the player does not contain a QuickTime VR movie, its <b>tilt</b> <glossary tag="property">property</glossary> is zero.</p>
