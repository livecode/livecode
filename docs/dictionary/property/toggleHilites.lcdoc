Name: toggleHilites

Type: property

Syntax: set the toggleHilites of <field> to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether clicking a <selected> line in a <list field> deselects that line.

Associations: field

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the toggleHilites of field "Movies" to true

Value (bool):The <toggleHilites> of a <field(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <toggleHilites> <property> of newly created <field(object)|fields> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <toggleHilites> <property> to control the <behavior> of <list field|list fields>.

If a field's <toggleHilites> <property> is set to true, clicking a <selected> line deselects the line. If the <toggleHilites> is false, clicking a <selected> line does nothing.

If the field's <listBehavior> <property> is false, the setting of the <toggleHilites> <property> has no effect.

>*Important:*  Setting the <toggleHilites> to true automatically sets the <field|field's> <noncontiguousHilites> and <multipleLines> <properties> to true. (However, setting the <toggleHilites> to false does not set these <properties> back to false.) To set the <toggleHilites> to true and the <noncontiguousHilites> or <multipleLines> to false, be sure to set the <toggleHilites> first, then set the other <properties> to false.
