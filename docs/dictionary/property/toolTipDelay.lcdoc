Name: toolTipDelay

Type: property

Syntax: set the toolTipDelay to <milliseconds>

Summary:
Specifies how long the user must <point> to an <object(glossary)> with
the <mouse pointer> before its <tool tip> appears.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
set the toolTipDelay to 200 -- faster-than-default tooltip

Example:
set the toolTipDelay to 0 -- no tooltip

Value:
The <toolTipDelay> is a <non-negative> <integer>.
By default, the <toolTipDelay> is 500 (half a second).

Description:
Use the <toolTipDelay> <property> to control the responsiveness of <tool
tip|tool tips>.

A tool tip is a small box containing a line or two of text, which pops
up on the screen when the mouse pointer hovers over a control. Use the
<toolTip> <property> to set the contents of the <tool tip>.

The mouse must be still for the <toolTipDelay> time or the <tool tip>
will not appear. If the mouse remains within a <control>, but is
constantly moving, the <toolTipDelay> time does not start until the
mouse stops moving.

If the <toolTipDelay> is zero, the <tool tip> is disabled and does not
appear.
