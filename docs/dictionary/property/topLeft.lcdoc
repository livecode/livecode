Value:
The <topLeft> of an <object(glossary)> is any <expression> that
<evaluate|evaluates> to a <point> --two <integer|integers> separated by
a comma. The first item of the <topLeft> is the distance in <pixels>
from the left edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> (for all other
<object|objects>) to the left edge of the <object(glossary)>. The second
<item> is the distance in <pixels> from the top edge of the screen (for
<stacks>) or <card> (for all other <object|objects>) to the top edge of
the <object(glossary)>.

For cards, the <topLeft> <property> is <read-only> and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <topLeft> <property> to change the placement of a <control> or
window. 

The <topLeft> of a <stack> is in <absolute (screen)
coordinates(glossary)>. The first <item> (the <left>) of a card's
<topLeft> <property> is always zero; the second <item> (the <top>) is
always zero. The <topLeft> of a <group> or <control> is in <relative
(window) coordinates(glossary)>.

In window coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the stack
window. In screen coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the
screen. 

Changing the <topLeft> of an <object(glossary)> moves it to the new
position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> size, set
its <height>, <width>, or <rectangle> <properties>.

>*Important:*  The order of the top and left <parameter|parameters> is
> reversed compared to the <property> name: left comes first, then top.
