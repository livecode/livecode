Value:
The <topLeft> of an <object> is any <expression> that <evaluate|evaluates> to a <point> --two <integer|integers> separated by a comma.
The first item of the <topLeft> is the distance in <pixels> from the left edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> (for all other <object|objects>) to the left edge of the <object>. The second <item> is the distance in <pixels> from the top edge of the screen (for <stacks>) or <card> (for all other <object|objects>) to the top edge of the <object>.

For cards, the <topLeft> <property> is <read-only> and cannot be set.

Description:
Use the <topLeft> <property> to change the placement of a <control> or window.

The <topLeft> of a <stack> is in <absolute (screen) coordinates(glossary)>. The first <item> (the <left>) of a card's <topLeft> <property> is always zero; the second <item> (the <top>) is always zero. The <topLeft> of a <group> or <control> is in <relative (window) coordinates(glossary)>.

In window coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the stack window. In screen coordinates, the point 0,0 is at the top left of the screen.

Changing the <topLeft> of an <object> moves it to the new position without resizing it. To change an <object|object's> size, set its <height>, <width>, or <rectangle> <properties>.

>*Important:*  The order of the top and left <parameter|parameters> is reversed compared to the <property> name: left comes first, then top.
