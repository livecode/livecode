Name: topPattern

Type: property

Syntax: set the topPattern of <object> to {<patternNumber> | <imageID> | empty}

Summary:
Specifies the pattern used to draw a three-D <object|object's> raised
edge. 

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the topPattern of the mouseControl to 22

Example:
set the topPattern of field "List" to the topPattern of me

Value:
The <topPattern> of an <object(glossary)> is a pattern specifier.
A <patternNumber> is a built-in pattern number between 1 and 164. These
patterns are provided for compatibility with patterns available in
MetaCard and correspond to LiveCode's built in image id 137 to 300. As
with MetaCard pattern numbers 105 to 114 and 146 and above are 
unavailable.

An <imageID> is the ID of an <image> to use for a pattern. LiveCode
looks for the specified <image> first in the <current stack>, then in
other open <stacks>.

By default, the <topPattern> for all <object|objects> is empty.

Description:
Objects whose threeD <property> is set to true appear to stick out of or
recede into the screen. Use the <topPattern> <property> to specify the
pattern used to draw the raised edge of the <object(glossary)>.

Pattern images can be color or black-and-white.

>*Cross-platform note:*  To be used as a pattern on <Mac OS|Mac OS
> systems>, an <image> must be 128x128 <pixels> or less, and both its
> <height> and <width> must be a power of 2. To be used on <Windows> and
> <Unix|Unix systems>, <height> and <width> must be divisible by 8. To
> be used as a fully cross-platform pattern, both an image's dimensions
> should be one of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.

The <topPattern> of <control(object)|controls> is drawn starting at the
<control(object)|control's> upper right corner: if the
<control(keyword)> is moved, the pattern does not shift.

Setting the <topPattern> of an <object(glossary)> to empty allows the
<topPattern> of the object's <owner> to show through. Use the
<effective> <keyword> to find out what pattern is used for the
<object(glossary)>, even if its own <topPattern> is empty.

If the object's showBorder <property> is false, the <topPattern> has no
effect. 

The setting of the <topPattern> <property> has different effects,
depending on the <object type>:

* The <topPattern> of a <stack> determines the <topPattern> of each
  <object(glossary)> in the <stack> that does not have its own
  <topPattern>. 


* The <topPattern> of a <card> determines the pattern of the border on
  the top and left edges of the <card>, as well as determining the
  <topPattern> of each <object(glossary)> on the <card> that does not
  have its own <topPattern>.


* The <topPattern> of a <group> determines the pattern of the border on
  the <bottom> and right edges of the <group>, as well as determining
  the <topPattern> of each <object(glossary)> in the <group> that does
  not have its own <topPattern>.


* The <topPattern> of a <button(keyword)> forms a border on the top and
  left edges of the <button(keyword)>. If the <button(object)|button's>
  <threeD> <property> is false, the <topPattern> has no effect.


* The <topPattern> of a <field(keyword)> forms a border on the bottom
  and right edges of the <field(keyword)> and (if the <field(keyword)>
  is a scrolling <field(keyword)>) the top and left edges of the arrow
  boxes at the ends of the scrollbar and the bottom and right edges of
  the scroll area. The <field(object)|field's> <topPattern> also
  determines the pattern of the top and left edges of any text in the
  <field(keyword)> whose <textStyle> is set to "threeDBox". If the
  <field(object)|field's> <threeD> <property> is false, the
  <field(keyword)> border is not affected.


* The <topPattern> of a <scrollbar> forms a border on the top and left
  edges of the arrow boxes at the ends of the <scrollbar>, and the
  bottom and right edges of the scroll area.


* The <topPattern> of a <graphic>, <image>, <audio clip>, or <video
  clip> has no effect.


* The <topPattern> of a <player> or <EPS|EPS object> forms a border on
  the bottom and right edges of the <object(glossary)>. If the object's
  <threeD> <property> is false, the <topPattern> has no effect.


If an object's <topPattern> is set, the pattern is shown instead of the
color specified by the <topColor>.
