Name: traceDelay

Type: property

Syntax: set the traceDelay to <milliseconds> 

Summary: Used by the <debugger|script debugger> to specify how long to wait between lines when a <handler> is being traced.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,web

Example:
set the traceDelay to 1000 -- 1 second between steps

Value:
The <traceDelay> <property> is a positive <integer>.
By default, the <traceDelay> <property> is set to 500 (one-half second).

Description:
Use the <traceDelay> <property> to make tracing faster or slower.

When a handler is traced, each line is executed, after the delay specified in the <traceDelay> property. Using the <debugger|script debugger>, you can trace a <handler> slowly while watching the order in which lines are <execute|executed> and the value of <variable|variables> as they change, in order to track down any <error|errors> in the <handler>. Increasing the <traceDelay> causes the trace to take place more slowly, giving you more time to interpret the situation as the <handler> is traced. Decreasing the <traceDelay> speeds up tracing, which can be useful when <debug|debugging> long <handler|handlers>.

If the debugger is not active, this property has no effect.

>*Important:*  This <property> may change or be removed in future releases.
