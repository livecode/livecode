Name: traceReturn

Type: property

Syntax: set the traceReturn to {true | false}

Summary: Used by the <debugger|script debugger> to specify whether a <handler> is being traced through, line by line.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop,web

Example:
set the traceReturn to true

Value (bool): The <traceReturn> property is true or false.

Description:
Use the <traceReturn> <property> to step forward in the script being <debug|debugged>.

When a handler is traced, each line is executed, after a specified delay. Using the script debugger, you can trace a handler slowly while watching the order in which lines are executed and the value of variables as they change, in order to track down any errors in the handler.

If the debugger is not active, setting this property has no effect.

>*Important:*  This <property> may change or be removed in future releases.
