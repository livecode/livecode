Name: traversalOn

Type: property

Syntax: set the traversalOn of <object> to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether a <control> can become the <active (focused)
control(glossary)>. 

Associations: field, button, group

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the traversalOn of group "Arrows" to true

Example:
set the traversalOn of button "Help" to false

Value (bool):
A control's <traversalOn> <property> is true or false.

Description:
Use the <traversalOn> <property> to control whether the user can tab or
click into a <control>.

Setting a field's <traversalOn> to true enables the user to tab into or
click in the <field> for editing (if the <field(object)|field's>
<lockText> <property> is false). If a <field(object)|field's>
traversalOn and <lockText> <properties> are both set to true, the user
can <select> text, but not change it, and can scroll within the <field>
using the keyboard. If the <traversalOn> is true and the <lockText> is
false, the <field> can be edited. If the <lockText> is true and the
<traversalOn> is false, the user can neither <select> nor edit the
<field(object)|field's> text.

If the <object(glossary)> is a <group>, setting its <traversalOn> to
true causes tabbing into the <group> to set the <focus> to the first
<control> in the <group>.

If the <object(glossary)> is a <control> other than a <group> or
<field>, if its <traversalOn> is true, and if the <lookAndFeel> is set
to "Motif" or "Windows 95", the user can tab to the <control>, then
press Return or Enter to send a <mouseUp> <message> to the
<object(glossary)>. 

If the lookAndFeel is set to "Motif", "Macintosh", or
"Appearance Manager", the <active (focused) control(glossary)> is
outlined, and the <control> receives any keystrokes and the
<message|messages> associated with them. (The outline can be turned off
by setting the <field(object)|field's> <showFocusBorder> <property> to
false.) If the <lookAndFeel> is set to "Windows 95", the <appearance> of
a <focus|focused> <field> does not change, but it receives keystroke
<message|messages>. 

>*Important:*  If an <object|object's> <script> uses the text
> <selection>, make sure to set the <object|object's> <traversalOn>
> <property> to false, since clicking an <object(glossary)> whose
> <traversalOn> is true deselects any text <selection>.
