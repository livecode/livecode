Name: unicodeText

Type: property

Syntax: set the unicodeText of [<chunk> of] <field> to <unicodeString> 

Syntax: set the unicodeText of <button> to <unicodeString> 

Summary: Specifies the text in a <field>, represented as <Unicode> (double-byte characters).

Associations: field,button

Introduced: 2.0

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios,android

Example:

Example:

Example:

Value: The <unicodeText> is a UTF-16 string.

The result: As of LiveCode 7.0 the unicodeText property has been deprecated. It will continue to work as in previous versions but shoud not be used in new code as the existing behaviour is incompatible with the new, transparent Unicode handling (the resulting value will be treated as binary data rather than text). This functions is only useful in combination with the also-deprecated uniEncode and uniDecode function.

Description:
Use the <unicodeText> <property> to set or get the contents of a field or button as UTF-16.

>*Important:* 

Fields
Use the <unicodeText> property to display a unicode string in a field or retrieve the text displayed in a field as a unicode string.

Buttons
Use the <unicodeText> property to set the menu contents of a button(if it is a menu) to a unicode string. To set the label of a button to a unicode string use the <unicodeLabel> property.
