Name: useSystemDate

Type: property

Syntax: set the useSystemDate to {true | false}

Summary: Specifies whether the <date> and <time> <function|functions> should be formatted in accordance with the user's system preferences, or in the standard <format> used in the United States.

Introduced: 1.1

OS: mac,windows,linux,ios

Platforms: desktop,server,web,mobile

Example:
set the useSystemDate to true

Value (bool):The <useSystemDate> is true or false.
By default, the <useSystemDate> <property> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <useSystemDate> <property> to correctly format dates and times that will be viewed by the user (for example, dates and times that are displayed in a <field>).

Setting the <useSystemDate> <property> to true does the same thing as using the <system> <keyword> with the <date> or <time> <function|functions>. If the <useSystemDate> is set to true, the <date> and <time> <function|functions> <return> the same value as the system date and the system time, respectively. If the <useSystemDate> is set to false, the <date> and <time> <function|functions> <return> the same value as the english date and the english time, respectively.

The system format is set by the Date & Time control panel (on Mac OS systems), the Date control panel (on <Windows|Windows systems>), or the LANG <environment variable> (on <Unix|Unix systems>).

Since the <useSystemDate> is a <local property>, its <value> is <reset> to false when the current <handler> finishes <execute|executing>. It retains its <value> only for the current <handler>, and setting it in one <handler> does not affect its value in other <handler|handlers> it <call|calls>.
