Name: userLevel

Type: property

Syntax: set the userLevel to <number> 

Summary: Has no effect and is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with imported <HyperCard> stacks.

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop,server,web

Description:
In HyperCard, the <userLevel> <property> determines what actions the user can perform. In LiveCode, there are no separate user levels.

By default, the <userLevel> <property> is set to 8. (This is greater than any of the <value|values> permitted in HyperCard for the <userLevel> <property>, so <import|imported> <stacks> that check whether the <userLevel> is greater than a certain number will continue to work without modification.)

A handler can set the <userLevel> to any number without causing a <error|script error>, but the <behavior> of the <application> is not changed.
