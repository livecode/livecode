Name: vGrid

Type: property

Syntax: set the vGrid [of line <lineNumber>] of <field> to {true | false}

Summary:
Specifies whether a <field|field's> <tab stop|tab stops> are treated as
cell boundaries.

Associations: field

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the vGrid of the templateField to true

Example:
set the vGrid of line 10 to -1 of field 1 to true

Value (bool):
The <vGrid> of a <field(keyword)> is true or false.
By default, the <vGrid> <property> of newly created
<field(object)|fields> is set to false.

Description:
Use the <vGrid> <property> to make a field behave like a spreadsheet
with a grid of cells.

If the  <vGrid> <property> is true, LiveCode draws a vertical line at
each <tab stop> position in the <field(keyword)>. The lines are drawn in
the <field(object)|field's> <borderColor>. This <property> is useful for
<field(object)|fields> that are used like a spreadsheet, with each <tab
stop> marking a column.

Any text in a column is truncated when it reaches the right edge of the
column. To show the entire contents of the column, drag over the text to
select it. If text at the end of a line does not have a tab following
it--that is, if it's the last column in the field--it is not truncated.

If the field's <tabStops> <property> is set to empty, the <vGrid> lines
are drawn every 32 <pixels>, but the text is not truncated to individual
cells. 

Changes:
The use of the <borderColor> to draw grid lines was introduced in
version 2.0. In previous versions, the grid lines were drawn in the
<hiliteColor>.
