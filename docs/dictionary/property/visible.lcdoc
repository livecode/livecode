Value (bool): The <visible> of an <object> is true or false.

Description:
Use the <visible> <property> to determine whether an <object> is hidden or not, or to hide or show an <object>.

A hidden object is still present and still takes up memory, and a handler can access its properties and contents, but the user cannot see or or interact with it. 

An object that cannot be seen only because it's behind another object is still visible, in the sense that its <visible> <property> is still true. 

The <visible> <property> of <grouped control|grouped controls> is independent of the <visible> <property> of the <group(command)>. Setting a <group(glossary)|group's> <visible> <property> to false doesn't change the <visible> <property> of its <control|controls>; their <visible> <property> is still true, even though the <control|controls> cannot be seen because the <group(command)> is invisible. 

If you specify the effective keyword the visible property of a control returns true if, and only if, the control and all it's parent groups are visible.

You can set the <visible> <property> of a <card(keyword)>, but doing so has no effect. <card(object)|Cards> cannot be made invisible. 

The <visible> <property> is the logical inverse of the <invisible> <property>. When an <object|object's> <visible> is true, its <invisible> is false, and vice versa.
