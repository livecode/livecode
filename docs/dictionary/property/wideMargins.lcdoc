Description:
Use the <wideMargins> <property> to set all the margins of a <field> to 20 pixels.

The <wideMargins> <property> sets the blank space at the edges of a <field> to 20 <pixels>.

You can use the <margins property> instead to set all four <field> margins to any value. The <wideMargins> <property> is included in <LiveCode> for compatibility with imported <HyperCard> stacks.

The <wideMargins> <property> interacts with the <margins> : setting the <margins> <property> to 20 sets the <wideMargins> to true, and setting the <wideMargins> to true sets the <margins> to 20.
