Name: width

Type: property

Syntax: set the width of <object> to <numberOfPixels>

Summary:
The <width> of an <object(glossary)> is the distance from its left edge
to its right edge.

Associations: stack, card, field, button, graphic, scrollbar, player,
image

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux, ios, android

Platforms: desktop, server, mobile

Example:
set the width of the target to 100

Example:
set the width of button 1 to the formattedWidth of button 1

Value:
The <width> of an <object(glossary)> is a positive integer.

Description:
Use the <width> <property> to determine how much horizontal space an
<object(glossary)> needs, or to make it wider or narrower.

The <width> of a <card(keyword)> is always the same as the <width> of
its <stack window>. You can set the <width> of a <card(keyword)>, but
doing so has no effect and doesn't change the <card(object)|card's>
<width> <property>.

If you reduce the <width> of a <stack>, some <object|objects> may end up
outside the <stack window>. These <object|objects> are not shown;
however, they are still there, and will be displayed if you make the
window wide enough.

If the object's <lockLocation> <property> is false, when you change its
width, it shrinks or grows from the center: the <object|object's> left
and right edges both shift, while the object's <location> <property> stays
the same. If the <object|object's> <lockLocation> <property> is true, it
shrinks or grows from the top left corner: the <object|object's> left
edge stays in the same place, and the right edge moves.

The <width> of an object cannot be set to zero. Attempting to do so will
set the <width> to 1 instead.

>*Cross-platform note:*  On <Mac OS> and <OS X|OS X systems>, the
> maximum <width> of an <image> is 16384 divided by the screen's <bit
> depth>. (For example, if the number of colors is "Millions", the
> maximum image width is 4096 <pixels>.)

>*Note:* The current architecture uses 16-bit signed integers for all
> co-ordinates, which means that the value range is -32768 to 32767.
