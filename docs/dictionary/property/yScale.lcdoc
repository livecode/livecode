Name: yScale

Type: property

Syntax: set the yScale of <EPSObject> to <number>

Summary:
Specifies the ratio of the height of an <EPS|EPS object's> <PostScript>
bounding box to the object's screen height.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
set the yScale of last EPS to 2 -- PS image twice the height of screen

Example:
set the yScale of EPS "Guido" to 0.25 -- one-fourth the height

Value:
The <yScale> of an <EPS|EPS object> is a positive number.

Description:
Use the <yScale> <property> to control an <EPS|EPS object's> screen
appearance. 

The <number> 1 indicates no scaling--that is, the <EPS|EPS object's>
height is the same as the height specified by the <PostScript> code it
contains. Numbers greater than one indicate that the <object|object's>
height is less than the <PostScript> height; the screen
<object(glossary)> is scaled down. Numbers less than one indicate that
the <object|object's> height is greater than the <PostScript> height,
and the screen <object(glossary)> is scaled up from the <PostScript>.

In geometric terms, yScale = yExtent/height.

If the object's <scaleIndependently> <property> is false, the <yScale>
<property> is equal to the <scale> of the <object(glossary)>.

This property is supported only on Unix systems with Display PostScript
installed.
