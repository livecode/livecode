Name: zoomBox

Type: property

Syntax: set the zoomBox of <stack> to {true | false}

Summary: Shows a window's <zoom box>.

Synonyms: maximizeBox

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,windows,linux

Platforms: desktop

Example:
set the zoomBox of me to true

Example:
set the zoomBox of the templateStack to false

Value (bool): The <zoomBox> <property> of a <stack> is true or false. By <default>, the <zoomBox> of a newly created <stack> is set to true.

Description:
Use the <zoomBox> property to display the zoom box or maximize box in a window's title bar.

The terminology varies depending on platform. The <zoomBox> <property> determines whether the <zoom box> (Mac OS and OS X systems) or <maximize button|maximize box> (Unix and <Windows|Windows systems>) appears in a <stack window|stack window's> <title bar>.

>*Note:* On <OS X|OS X systems>, if the <zoomBox> <property> is false, the <zoom box> is disabled rather than hidden.

The setting of this property affects the <decorations property>, and vice versa. Setting a stack's <zoomBox> property determines whether its <decorations property> includes "maximize" (or is "default", for window styles that normally include a zoom box). Conversely, setting a stack's <decorations property> sets its <zoomBox> to true or false depending on whether the <decorations> includes "maximize" (or is "default").

Setting the <zoomBox> <property> causes the <stack window> to flash briefly.

Changes:
The synonym "maximizeBox" was added in version 2.1.
