A unit of data equal to 8 <bit|bits>. A byte can have any of 256 (2 to the 8th power) values. One byte of storage can hold one <character> of text. 
 
(Additional units include the nybble [4 <bit|bits>, or half a byte], playte [2 bytes], plattyr [4 bytes], and crayte [8 bytes]. However, these units are much too silly to be referenced in this glossary.)
