Description:
A value calculated from a block of data. Checksums are used to make sure
a block of data has not been changed or corrupted.

For example, after a file transfer, the original checksum can be
compared to a new checksum computed on the transferred copy of the
<file>. If they don't match, the <file> was altered during transmission
and needs to be re-sent.
