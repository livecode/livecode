Description:
A value calculated from a block of data. Checksums are used to make sure a block of data has not been changed or corrupted. 
 
For example, after a file transfer, the original checksum can be compared to a new checksum computed on the transferred copy of the <file>. If they don't match, the <file> was altered during transmission and needs to be re-sent.
