	<term>checksum</term>
	<definition><p>A value calculated from a block of data. Checksums are used to make sure a block of data has not been changed or corrupted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, after a file transfer, the original checksum can be compared to a new checksum computed on the transferred copy of the <keyword tag="file">file</keyword>. If they don't match, the <keyword tag="file">file</keyword> was altered during transmission and needs to be re-sent.</p></definition>
