	<term>double-byte font</term>
	<definition><p>A font in which each character is represented by 2 bytes. Languages such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, which contain more symbols than can be represented by 256 code points, require double-byte character sets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Double-byte fonts usually also contain a full complement of alphabetic characters occupying the first 256 positions in the font, so you can display Roman-alphabet text and Unicode text using the same font.</p></definition>
