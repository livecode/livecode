Name: eon

Synonyms: eon, aeon

Type: glossary

Description:
The period of time used as the baseline for a computer system or
program. Since only finite numbers can be represented in a computer,
operating systems and programs that deal with dates must use a starting
and ending date; dates outside that range require special handling.

LiveCode uses midnight, January 1, 1970 as the start of the eon. Date
and time functions are computed from that date.
