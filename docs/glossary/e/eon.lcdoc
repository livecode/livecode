Description:
The period of time used as the baseline for a computer system or program. Since only finite numbers can be represented in a computer, operating systems and programs that deal with dates must use a starting and ending date; dates outside that range require special handling. 
 
LiveCode uses midnight, January 1, 1970 as the start of the eon. Date and time functions are computed from that date.
