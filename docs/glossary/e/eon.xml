	<term>eon</term>
	<definition><p>The period of time used as the baseline for a computer system or program. Since only finite numbers can be represented in a computer, operating systems and programs that deal with dates must use a starting and ending date; dates outside that range require special handling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>LiveCode uses midnight, January 1, 1970 as the start of the eon. Date and time functions are computed from that date.</p></definition>
