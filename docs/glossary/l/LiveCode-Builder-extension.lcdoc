Description:
An extension to the LiveCode environment written in the 
<LiveCode Builder language>. The extension can be either a <widget> or 
a <library extension|library>. 

A <widget> when loaded is a <control> that can be created on the <stack>
by dragging it out from the tools palette, or using the <create widget>
command. 

A <library extension|library> when loaded has its public handlers added
to the bottom of the <message path> and then called in LiveCode in
exactly the same way as script handlers.
