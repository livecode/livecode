Description:
An extension to the LiveCode environment written in the <LiveCode Builder language>.
The extension can be either a <widget> or a <library extension|library>.

A <widget> when loaded is a <control> that can be created on the <stack> by dragging it out from the tools palette, or using the <create widget> command.

A <library extension|library> when loaded has its public handlers added to the bottom of the <message path> and then called in LiveCode in exactly the same way as script handlers.
