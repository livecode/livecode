Description:
<LiveCode Builder> is a variant of the current <LiveCode> scripting language which has been designed for 'systems' building. It is statically compiled with optional static typing and direct foreign code interconnect (allowing easy access to APIs written in other languages). The compiled bytecode can then be packaged together with any required resources (icons, documentation, images, etc) into a .lce extension package.

Unlike most languages, <LiveCode Builder> has been designed around the idea of extensible syntax. Indeed, the core language is very small - comprising declarations and control structures - with the majority of the language syntax and functionality being defined in modules.

The syntax will be familiar to anyone who has coded with <LiveCode|LiveCode Script>, however <LiveCode Builder> is a great deal more strict - the reason being it is intended that it will eventually be compilable to machine code with the performance and efficiency you'd expect from any 'traditional' programming language. Indeed, over time we hope to move the majority of implementation of the whole LiveCode system over to being written in <LiveCode Builder>.

There are two types of extensions which can be written in <LCB>: <widget|widgets> and <library extension|libraries>. All installed <LiveCode Builder extension|extensions> appear in the new Extension Manager stack, which can be opened from the Tools menu. 

An <library extension|LCB library> is a new way of adding functions to the <LiveCode> <message path>. Public handlers in loaded <library extension|LCB libraries> are available to call from <LiveCode Script>. 

A <widget> is a new type of custom <control> which, once compiled and packaged, can be loaded into the <IDE>. Using the <widget> is no different from any of the classic <LiveCode> controls you've been used to. Simply drag it onto a <stack> and start interacting with it as you would any another <control>.

For detailed information about using <LCB>, please consult the Extending LiveCode guide, and explore the <LCB> API by selecting <LiveCode Builder> from the API dropdown menu.
