Synonyms: network byte order

Type: glossary

Description:
The <byte order> used by a network. To avoid confusion, all systems on a
network use the same <byte order> when communicating with each other,
even if they use a different <byte order> internally.

For the Internet, by convention, the network byte order is "big-endian",
with the most significant <byte> first.
