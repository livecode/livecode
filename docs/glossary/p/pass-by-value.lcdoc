Description:
A way of using <parameter|parameters> where the <value|values> of the <argument|arguments> are passed to the <call|called> <handler>, but changing the <parameter|parameters> within the <call|called> <handler> has no effect on the <call|calling> <handler>. 
 
If you pass a <variable> by value to another <handler>, the other <handler> can't affect the <variable|variable's> <value> in the original <handler>.
