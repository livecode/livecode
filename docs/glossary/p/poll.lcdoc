Description:
To repeatedly check a status (such as whether the <mouse button> is down or whether a process has completed). 
 
(Polling is usually considered a less desirable technique than sending a <message> when the status changes, because it takes more processing time to repeatedly check the status and can slow down other programs on the system.)
