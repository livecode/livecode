	<definition><p>To repeatedly check a status (such as whether the <glossary tag="mouse button">mouse button</glossary> is down or whether a process has completed).</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Polling is usually considered a less desirable technique than sending a <keyword tag="message box">message</keyword> when the status changes, because it takes more processing time to repeatedly check the status and can slow down other programs on the system.)</p></definition>
