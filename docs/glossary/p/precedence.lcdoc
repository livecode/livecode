Description:
The set of rules that determine what order <operator|operators> are <evaluate|evaluated> in, in an <expression> that has more than one <operator>. 
 
For example, the * <operator> has higher precedence than the + <operator>, so 
  2 + 3 * 4 
is <evaluate|evaluated> as 2 + (3 * 4), not (2 + 3) * 4.
