Description:

When saving a <stack> using the <save> <command>, it is possible to save with a specific version of LiveCode's stack <file> format.  This is useful when saving a stack so that it can be saved in an older <version|version of LiveCode>, but it should be used with caution.

**Warning:** Using a non-default <stack version> could result in data being lost when stacks are saved.  In particular, any features that are not present in the target version may be lost.  For example, using a <stack version> of "2.4" will cause any <blendLevel> or <ink> properties to be lost.

These are the <stack version|stack file format versions> that can be used with the <save> command, and the versions of LiveCode that they are compatible with:

* "8.0": (Default) LiveCode 8.0.0 and later
* "7.0": LiveCode 7.0.0 up to LiveCode 8.0.0
* "5.5": LiveCode 5.5.0 up to LiveCode 7.0
* "2.7": LiveCode 2.6.1 up to LiveCode 5.5.0
* "2.4": LiveCode older than 2.6.1

When saving in the **7.0 format**, all <widget|widgets> will be lost.

When saving in the **5.5 format**, all <Unicode> text will be lost unless it is stored in a container that has a Unicode variant.  For example, this means that Unicode text in <field|fields> and <button> labels will be saved, but any Unicode text in <script|scripts> or <custom properties> will be lost.

When saving in the **2.7 format**, the following properties or property aspects will also be lost:

* <textFont> property: separation lost
* <textStyle> property: separation lost
* <textSize> property: separation lost
* <unicodeToolTip> property: lost
* all paragraph level properties: lost
* separation of Unicode attribute of chars: lost
* character level metadata property: lost

When saving in the **2.4 format**, the following properties will also be lost or altered:

* <antialiased> property: lost
* <ink> property: lost for <card|cards>, reverted to "GXcopy" for controls if not supported
* <opaque> property: lost for cards
* <blendLevel> property: lost
