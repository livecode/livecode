Description:
Memory that is temporarily allocated by Mac OS to applications on
request. 

On Mac OS systems, each application has a fixed amount of memory, which
is set in the application's "Get Info" window. Temporary memory is in
addition to this allocation, and is responsible for applications taking
more memory than their allocation.
