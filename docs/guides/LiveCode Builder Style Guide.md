# LiveCode Builder Style Guide

## Introduction

This document describes best practices to be followed when working with
LiveCode Builder source code.  Please follow it *especially* when writing code
to be included with the main LiveCode product package.

## Copyright headers

Please include a license header at the top of the `.lcb` file.

For the main LiveCode repository, or for any community extensions, the license
is the [GNU General Public License v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses) *without*
the "any later version" clause.

## Naming

### Module name

The module name uses reverse DNS notation.  For example, a module created by
the Example Organization would use module names beginning with `org.example`.

Replace any hyphen (`-`) characters in a domain name with underscore (`_`)
characters.  For example, a module derived from the `fizz-buzz.example.org`
domain could be `org.example.fizz_buzz`.

Additionally, add an underscore (`_`) to the start of any element in the domain
name starting with a digit.  For example, a module derived from the
`999.example.org` domain could be `org.example._999`.

You must only use module names corresponding to domain names that you control
or are allowed to use.  This restriction is enforced by the the LiveCode
extension store.

If you don't have a domain name of your own, you may use module names
beginning with `community.livecode.<username>`, replacing `<username>`
with the username you use to log into the LiveCode extension store.
For example, if your username is "sophie", then you can create a
module named `community.livecode.sophie.mymodule`.

For the main LiveCode repository, please use module names beginning with
`com.livecode`.

Always write module names in lower case.

### Naming variables and parameters

Give variables and parameters `xCamelCaseNames` with a leading lowercase
character indicating their scope and availability.

The meanings of the leading lowercase characters are:

Prefix | Context             | Meaning
------ | ------------------- | -------
k      | all                 | constant
s      | module              | static variable
m      | widget              | static variable
p      | handler definitions | `in` argument
r      | handler definitions | `out` argument
x      | handler definitions | `inout` argument
t      | handler bodies      | local variable

In general, please use nouns to name your variables and parameters.  Make the
names descriptive; for example:

    variable tOutputPath as String  -- Good
    variable tString as String      -- Bad

For `Boolean` variables, please try to use "yes or no" names.  For example:

    variable tIsVisible as Boolean
    variable tHasContents as Boolean

### Naming handlers

Give handlers `camelCase` names.

Use verbs to name your handlers.  For example,

    handler rotateShape(inout xShape, in pAngleInDegrees)
       -- ...
    end handler

### Naming types

Give types `TitleCase` names.

To distinguish from handlers, use nouns to name your types.  For example,

    type RotationAngle is Number

## Documenting the source code

In-line documentation for a definition is extracted from a
`/** */` comment block immediately before the start of the definition.

Always add a top-level documentation block at the start of the LCB
file describing your widget, library or module.  In addition, add
in-line documentation to all of the following:

- `syntax` definitions
- `property` definitions
- `public handler` definitions in libraries and modules
- `public variable` definitions in modules

It is particularly important to add documentation to all syntax and to
any public handlers that aren't primarily accessed using syntax.

Additionally, add documentation for all messages that are posted by a
widget.  The documentation for each message must be placed in the
top-level documentation block for the widget.  For example:

    /*
    The navigation bar widget is intended for use in mobile apps for
    switching between cards, although there are many other possible
    uses.

    ...

    Name: hiliteChanged
    Type: message
    Syntax: on hiliteChanged
    Summary: Sent when a navigation item is selected

    ...
    */
    widget com.livecode.widget.navbar
    -- ..
    end widget

Please refer to the [Extending LiveCode](Extending LiveCode.md) guide for full
details of the syntax of in-line documentation comments, including examples.

## Named constants

Often, it is useful to use constant values in your code.  Please declare named
constants rather than placing the values in-line.  For example, you may
want to create three tabs labelled "Things", "Stuff", and "Misc":

    constant kTabNames is ["Things", "Stuff", "Misc"]

    handler createTabs()
       variable tName
       repeat for each element tName in kTabNames
          -- Create the tab
       end repeat
    end handler

In particular, please avoid any "magic numbers" in your code.

## Whitespace

### Indentation

Please indent with tab characters.  Use one tab character per level of
indentation.

Please do not use a level of indentation at `module` level.

Comments should be indented to the same level as the code they apply to.

For example:

    module org.example.indent

    -- Example handler
    handler fizzBuzz(in pIsFizz)
       if pIsFizz then
          return "Fizz"
       else
          -- Maybe this should have a capital letter
          return "buzz"
       end if
    end handler

    end module

If it's necessary to mix spaces and tabs for indentation, please use 3 spaces
per tab.

### Wrapping

Avoid lines longer than 80 characters.  Break long lines using a \\
continuation character.  Indent continuation lines by two levels. For
example:

    constant kWordList is ["a", "very", "long", "list", "that", "is", "much",\\
          "more", "readable", "when", "wrapped", "nicely"]

When breaking a handler definition or handler type definition, break
long lines at commas:

    handler processStringAndArray(in pStringArg as String, \\
          in pArrayArg as Array) returns Boolean

### Handler declarations, definitions and calls

In handler definitions and handler type definitions, don't insert
whitespace between the handler name and the parameter list.  For
example:

    handler type Fizzer()   -- Good
    handler type Buzzer ()  -- Bad

In handler parameter lists, please add a space between each parameter.  For
example:

    handler formatAsString(in pValue, out rFormat) -- Good
    handler isEqualTo(in pLeft,in pRight)          -- Bad

Please observe the same formatting in handler calls.  For example:

    variable tFormatted
    variable tIsEqual
    formatAsString(3.1415, tFormatted)             -- Good
    isEqualTo (tFormatted,"3.1415") into tIsEqual  -- Bad

### List and array literals

In list and array literals, please add a space between each element,
after the comma.  For array literals, also insert space between key
and value, after the colon.  For example:

    constant kPowersOfTwo is [1, 2, 4, 8]
    constant kBorderWidths is {"top": 0, "bottom": 0, "left": 1, "right": 2}

## Widget-specific guidelines

This section contains recommendations that are specific to writing
widgets.

As a general rule, try to minimize surprise for users who mix widgets
with classic LiveCode controls by using similarly named events and
properties with similar semantics.

### Writing load handlers

When writing an `onLoad()` handler to initialise a widget from
serialised state:

- Always call property setters to update the widget state.  Do not set
  instance variables directly.
- Always check that the property array contains each key rather than
  accessing it unilaterally.
- If keys are absent from the property array, do not set them to
  default values.  Rely on the `onCreate()` handler to have already
  done that.

Example:

    public handler onLoad(in pProperties)
       if "showBorder" is among the keys of pProperties then
          setShowBorder(pProperties["showBorder"])
       end if
       if "opaque" is among the keys of pProperties then
          setShowBackground(pProperties["opaque"])
       end if
    end handler

### Classic control properties

Where possible, try to make the names and effects of widget
properties as similar as possible to properties of classic controls.
For example:

- **label**: the text for the primary text label
- **showBorder**: whether to display an outline
- **opaque**: whether to fill in the background

### Host control properties

When relying on properties that are implemented by the widget host
control, such as the classic color and pattern properties, include
`metadata` definitions to display them in the PI, but do not include a
`property` definition.

Because there is no `property` definition, the documentation for the
host control property must be placed in the top-level documentation
block comment before the start of widget definition.

For example, to shadow the `borderColor` host control property:

    /**
    Test widget that demonstrates shadowing the
    <borderColor(property)> property.

    ...

    Name: borderColor
    Type: property

    Syntax: set the borderColor of <widget> to <color>
    Syntax: get the borderColor of <widget>

    Summary: Color for drawing circular outline

    Description:
    The <borderColor> property controls the color used to draw the
    widget's outline.
    */
    widget org.example.host_control_property

    -- ...

    metadata borderColor.editor  is "com.livecode.pi.color
    metadata borderColor.section is "Colors"
    metadata borderColor.label   is "Border color"
    metadata borderColor.default is "109,109,109"

    -- ...

    end widget

### Events

Always implement:

- `onCreate()`
- `onSave()`
- `onLoad()`
- `onPaint()`

You should _usually_ implement:

- `onGeometryChanged()`: if you have any non-trivial recomputation
  required to handle resizing
- `onMouseDown()`/`onMouseUp()`/`onMouseMove()`: always `post` these to
  script in order to behave like a classic control
