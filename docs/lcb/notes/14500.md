* Widgets now have access to their enable state.
  * The `my enabled` property returns `true` if the widget is currently enabled
  * The `my disabled` property returns `true` if the widget is currently disabled
  * If script changes the **enabled** (or **disabled**) property of
    the widget then an `OnParentPropChanged` message will be sent.
