## Determining if a widget is enabled

* It is now possible to determine the enabled state of a widget from within its script.
  * The `my enabled` property returns true if the widget is currently enabled
  * The `my disabled` property returns true if the widget is currently disabled
  * If script changes the enabled (or disabled) property of the widget then an OnParentPropChanged message will be sent.
