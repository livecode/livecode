## Mathematical functions

* Several mathematical functions now throw "domain errors" when
  applied to values that the function is not defined for, including
  `log10()`, `ln()`, `asin()` and `acos()`, and `x ^ y`.

# [14678] Throw error on domain error in log10() and ln()
# [14679] Throw error on domain error in pow()
# [14681] Throw error on domain error in asin() and acos()
