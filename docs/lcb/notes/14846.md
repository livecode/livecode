# LiveCode Builder Standard Library
## Sequence operations

* New syntax has been added for searching partial contents of sequence types (`List`, `String` and `Data`) based on the `offset` operation.
  * `the offset of <Needle> before <Position> in <Haystack>`
  * `the offset of <Needle> after <Position> in <Haystack>`
  * Equivalent syntax has been added for the `index` operation.

# [14846] Fixed and reinstated "offset before" and "offset after"
