# LiveCode Builder Host Library

## Widget library

* Widgets now have access to their effective font.

  * The **textFont**, **textSize** and **textStyle** properties have
    been reserved for use by the widget host.
  * A new `my font` expression has been added which evaluates to a
    `Font` matching the current effective values of the text
    properties that have been set on the widget.

# [14898] Add access to widget's effective font.
