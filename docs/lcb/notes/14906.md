# LiveCode Builder Language

## Change to handler return type syntax.

* The syntax for declaring the return type for a handler, or handler type has been changed to `[ 'returns' 'nothing' | 'returns' <Type> ]`.
* The previous syntax `as <Type>` or `as undefined` will continue to be supported until dp-4 at which point it will be removed along with the `undefined` type keyword.
* The compiler will emit warnings for the use of the deprecated syntax.

# [14906] Change 'as <Type>' to 'returns nothing' or 'returns <Type>' in handler return type definitions.
