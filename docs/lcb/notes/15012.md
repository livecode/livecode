## Detecting successive clicks

* The OnClick event is sent every time a mouseDown/mouseUp sequence is detected by the engine on a widget.
* Use 'the click count' syntax to fetch the number of successive clicks which happened close together and within a certain time of each other.

# [15012] Fix OnClick and provide a way to get the number of successive clicks.
