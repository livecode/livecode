## Widget library

* Improved tools for detecting repeated clicks on widgets

  * The `OnClick` event is sent every time a mouseDown/mouseUp
    sequence is detected by the engine on a widget.
  * `the click count` expression evaluates to the number of successive
    clicks which happened close together and within a certain time of
    each other.

# [15012] Fix OnClick and provide a way to get the number of successive clicks.
