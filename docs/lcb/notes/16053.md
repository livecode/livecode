# LiveCode Builder Host Library
## Canvas library

* "Outer shadow" effects now have a **knockout** (*Boolean*) property.  It controls whether or not the alpha channel of the source image is applied to the blurred shadow created by the effect, and defaults to `true`.
* "Inner glow" effects now have a **source** (*String*) property, which determines the location from which the glow originates.  It can be either "center" or or "edge", and defaults to "edge".
