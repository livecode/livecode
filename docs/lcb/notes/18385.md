# LiveCode Builder Tools
## lc-run

* **lc-run** now has the *experimental* ability to load and run
  bytecode assemblies containing multiple LCB modules.  To construct a
  multi-module bytecode assembly, simply concatenate several `.lcm`
  module files together.  The first module found in a bytecode assembly
  is treated as its main module.

# [18385] lc-run: Load multi-module bytecode assemblies.
