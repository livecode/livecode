* The `execute script` command has been improved and now allows
  specification of a target object and list of arguments. For example:

    variable tScriptObject as ScriptObject
    resolve script object "this card" into tScriptObject
    execute script "return param(1) + param(2)" in tScriptObject with [1, 2]

# [19066] Improve LCB 'execute script' command.
