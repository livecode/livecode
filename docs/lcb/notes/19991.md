## Variadic foreign C functions

* It is now possible to bind to variadic C functions:
  foreign handler printf(in pFormat as Pointer, ...) returns CInt binds to "<builtin>"
  In this case, the '...' must be the last parameter, and there must be at
  least one fixed parameter.

# [19991] Add support for variadic foreign C functions.
