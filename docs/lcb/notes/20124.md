## Foreign Function Interface

* It is now possible to specify the thread to be used in Obj-C foreign handlers. This is done by appending `?<thread>` to the end of the binding string. Currently the only supported value is `ui`, for running the handler on the iOS main thread, as opposed to the engine thread.
