## Foreign function interface

* Natural integer types NaturalSInt and NaturalUInt have been added to the 
  foreign module. These map to 32-bit or 64-bit integers, depending on the bitness
  of the processor.

* A natural float type NaturalFloat has been added to the foreign module. This
  maps to float on 32-bit processors and double on 64-bit processors.
