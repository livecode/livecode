# Platform support
The engine supports a variety of operating systems and versions. This section describes the platforms that we ensure the engine runs on without issue (although in some cases with reduced functionality).

## Windows

LiveCode supports the following versions of Windows:

* Windows 7 (both 32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows Server 2008
* Windows 8.x (Desktop)
* Windows 10

**Note:** On 64-bit Windows installations, LiveCode runs as a 32-bit application through the WoW layer.

## Linux

LiveCode supports the following Linux distributions, on 32-bit or
64-bit Intel/AMD or compatible processors:

* Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04
* Fedora 23 & 24
* Debian 7 (Wheezy) and 8 (Jessie) [server]
* CentOS 7 [server]

LiveCode may also run on Linux installations which meet the following
requirements:

* Required dependencies for core functionality:
  * glibc 2.13 or later
  * glib 2.0 or later

* Optional requirements for GUI functionality:
  * GTK/GDK 2.24 or later
  * Pango with Xft support
  * esd (optional, needed for audio output)
  * mplayer (optional, needed for media player functionality)
  * lcms (optional, required for color profile support in images)
  * gksu (optional, required for privilege elevation support)

**Note:** If the optional requirements are not present then LiveCode will still run but the specified features will be disabled.

**Note:** The requirements for GUI functionality are also required by Firefox and Chrome, so if your Linux distribution runs one of those, it will run LiveCode.

**Note:** It may be possible to compile and run LiveCode Community for Linux on other architectures but this is not officially supported.

## Mac
The Mac engine supports:

* 10.9.x (Mavericks)
* 10.10.x (Yosemite)
* 10.11.x (El Capitan)
* 10.12.x (Sierra)
* 10.13.x (High Sierra)
* 10.14.x (Mojave)
* 10.15.x (Catalina)
* 11.x (Big Sur)

## iOS
iOS deployment is possible when running LiveCode IDE on a Mac, and provided Xcode is installed and has been set in LiveCode *Preferences* (in the *Mobile Support* pane).

Currently, the supported versions of Xcode are:
* Xcode 8.2 on MacOS X 10.11
* Xcode 9.2 on MacOS 10.12 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.12.6)
* Xcode 10.1 on MacOS 10.13 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.13.4)
* Xcode 11.3 on MacOS 10.14 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.14.4) 
* Xcode 12.1 on MacOS 10.15 (Note: You need to upgrade to 10.15.4) 

It is also possible to set other versions of Xcode, to allow testing
on a wider range of iOS simulators. For instance, on MacOS 10.12
(Sierra), you can add *Xcode 8.2* in the *Mobile Support* preferences,
to let you test your stack on the *iOS Simulator 10.2*.

We currently support building against the following versions of the iOS SDK:

* 10.2 (included in Xcode 8.2)
* 11.2 (included in Xcode 9.2)
* 12.1 (included in Xcode 10.1)
* 13.2 (included in Xcode 11.3)
* 14.1 (included in Xcode 12.1)

## Android


LiveCode allows you to save your stack as an Android application, and
also to deploy it on an Android device or simulator from the IDE.

Android deployment is possible from Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

The Android engine supports devices using x86, x86-64, ARM and ARM64 processors.
It will run on the following versions of Android:

* 5.0-5.1 (Lollipop)
* 6.0 (Marshmallow)
* 7.x (Nougat)
* 8.x (Oreo)
* 9.0 (Pie)
* 10.0 (Q)


To enable deployment to Android devices, you need to download the
[Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other), and
then use the 'Android SDK Manager' to install:

* the latest "Android SDK Tools"
* the latest "Android SDK Platform Tools"

You also need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK).  On Linux,
this usually packaged as "openjdk".  LiveCode requires JDK version 1.6
or later.

Once you have set the path of your Android SDK in the "Mobile Support"
section of the LiveCode IDE's preferences, you can deploy your stack
to Android devices.

Some users have reported successful Android Watch deployment, but it
is not officially supported.

## HTML5

LiveCode applications can be deployed to run in a web browser, by running the LiveCode engine in JavaScript and using modern HTML5 JavaScript APIs.

HTML5 deployment does not require any additional development tools to be installed.

LiveCode HTML5 standalone applications are currently supported for running in recent versions of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://support.apple.com/HT204416).  For more information, please see the "HTML5 Deployment" guide in the LiveCode IDE.
