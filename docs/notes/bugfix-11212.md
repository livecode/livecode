# AppleScript does not work on LiveCode IDE
This issue has been fixed. It was caused by incorrect naming of the rsrc file - it was LiveCode.rsrc rather than LiveCode-Community.rsrc or LiveCode-Commercial.rsrc. (The name of the rsrc file has to match the name of the executable file within the bundle).
