# Support for Arm v6 iOS builds dropped

The earliest version of iOS supported by LiveCode is 4.3. Since iOS 4.3 only runs on Arm v7 (and newer) devices, support for Arm v6 (and subsequently universal builds) has been dropped. This has in turn simplified the versions of Xcode a user needs to have installed in order to perform iOS device builds:

|Platform|Xcode Version|iOS SDK Version|
-
|10.8|5.0|7.0|
|10.7|4.6|6.1|
|10.6|4.2|5.0|
