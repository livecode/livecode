# Improve printing on Linux.

Printing on Linux will now use the PDF Printer, and generate a PDF
which is then passed to the Linux printing subsystem. This vastly
improves the quality of the printed output, in particular enabling
Unicode text support.

Note: In order to use printing on Linux in standalones, you must
now ensure you select 'PDF Printer' in the General pane of the
standalone settings window.
