# Only allow interaction with scrollbars on groups in browse mode.
Previously scrollbars on groups would be manipulatable with any tool - this made it more difficult to select groups in pointer mode and to resize them using the handles. Group scrollbars will now only be active in browse tool mode - this is consistent with the field which has the same behavior.
