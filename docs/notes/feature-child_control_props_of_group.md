# The childControlNames and childControlIds of group
Two new properties **the childControlNames** and **the childControlsIds** have been added to the group object. These properties return a list of names (or ids) of all the direct children of the group. (This is in contrast to the controlNames and controlIds properties which recurse into subgroups).
