# New WebAssembly option for HTML5 deployment of LiveCode apps (experimental)

The LiveCode engine can now be deployed to HTML5 as WebAssembly.
WebAssembly is supported in most major web browsers and allows HTML5
apps to run at near-native speeds.

To used WebAssembly when deploying a stack as an HTML5 application,
enable the "Build for WebAssembly" checkbox on the "HTML5" page of the
standalone settings window, and then generate the standalone in the
normal way.

For more information on HTML5 deployment, including options for
embedding LiveCode standalones in web pages, please see the "HTML5
Deployment" guide in the IDE dictionary.
