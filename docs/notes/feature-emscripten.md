# New HTML5 deployment platform for LiveCode apps (experimental)

The LiveCode engine will now run in web browsers that support HTML5.
This means that you can now deploy simple LiveCode apps to users
without any installation required.

To deploy a stack as an HTML5 application, enable the "Build for
HTML5" checkbox on the "HTML5" page of the standalone settings window,
and then generate the standalone in the normal way.

For more information on HTML5 deployment, including options for
embedding LiveCode standalones in web pages, please see the "HTML5
Deployment" guide in the IDE dictionary.
