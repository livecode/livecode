# New **showAll** fullscreenmode.

This adds a new option for the stack **fullscreenmode** property:

* "showAll" - scale the stack preserving aspect ratio so all content within the stack rect is visible. Portions of the stack outside the stack rect will be visible if the scaled stack does not fit the screen exactly.
