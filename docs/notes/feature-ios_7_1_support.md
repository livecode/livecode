# iOS 7.1 Support

Support has been added for iOS 7.1. For OS 10.8 and 10.9, LiveCode now uses the iOS 7.1 SDK to produce device builds. As such, OS 10.8 and 10.9 users must have the iOS 7.1 SDK installed (which comes with Xcode 5.1) and configured in their mobile preferences in order to produce iOS device builds.
