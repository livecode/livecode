# iOS 8.1 Support
Support has been added to LiveCode 6.6.5 allowing 10.9 and 10.10 users to build using the iOS 8.1 SDK. This means that users can now test using the iOS 8.1 simulators that are included with XCode 6.1. Also, users running 10.9 and 10.10 must have XCode 6.1 installed in order to produce (iOS 8.1) device builds. iOS support for all other versions of OS X remains unchanged.
