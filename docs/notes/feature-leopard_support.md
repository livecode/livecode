# OS 10.5 (Leopard) Support

As of version 6.7-dp-1, Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) support has been dropped from LiveCode. This is primarily for technical reasons: In order to support the latest OS X features (e.g. Cocoa)  dropping 10.5 support was required.

As Leopard was the last Mac version to support PPC, support for the PPC architecture has also been dropped and the Universal and PPC options have been removed from the Standalone Builder.

Users wishing to produce 10.5 compatible executables can still do so using LiveCode version 6.6.x (and earlier).
