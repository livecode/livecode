# revvideograbber end-of-life on Mac OS X

The revvideograbber external depends on QuickTime in order to operate
on Mac OS X.  On Mac OS X 10.9 and above, QuickTime is no longer
available.

The revvideograbber external remains available for use on Windows,
using Video for Windows (DirectShow).

The following revvideograbber commands are now deprecated and have no
effect:

- **revVideoGrabSettings**
- **revSetVideoGrabSettings**
- **revVideoGrabIdle**
