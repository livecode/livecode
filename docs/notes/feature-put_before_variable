#  Allow 'put "x" before aVar' without replacing the contents of aVar with "x"

It is now possible to use 'put "someString" before someVariable' to prepend a (string) value to an existing (string) value of a variable:

put "x" into tOutput
put "y" before tOutput
put "z" before tOutput
put tOutput

Previously, tOutput would be "z". Now, it will be "zyx".
