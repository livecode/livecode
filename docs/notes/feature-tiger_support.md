# OS 10.4 (Tiger) Support

As of version 6.6-dp-1, OS 10.4 (Tiger) support has been dropped from LiveCode. This is primarily for technical reasons: In order to support the latest OS X features (e.g. Cocoa) as well as include the newest versions of thirdparty libraries (e.g. LibSkia, LibSQLite), dropping 10.4 support was required.

Users wishing to produce 10.4 compatible executables can still do so using LiveCode version 6.5.x (and earlier).
