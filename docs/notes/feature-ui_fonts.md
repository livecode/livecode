# Themed UI fonts

LiveCode 8.0 has improved the native look-and-feel of stacks written for desktop platforms, particularly when it comes to fonts. However, LiveCode lacked an easy way to request the use of an appropriately themed font explicitly.

A number of special font names have now been added to LiveCode so you can, for example, set the font of a control to the default font used for buttons. To find out more, see the dictionary entry for the **fontNames** function.
