# Xcode 7.0

iOS 9.0 SDK is now part of the valid SDKs that can be used for iOS standalone application deployment, from Mac OSX 10.10.4.

If you installed the new version of Xcode at another location than the previous one, we invite you to update the Xcode in Preferences > Mobile Preferences.

All the previously existing versions of iOS supported are still supported.
