#Known issues

Every effort has been made to ensure that externally, the engine behaviour is identical to the current unrefactored release. In other words, users should not notice any difference in functionality in their existing stacks. However, users will notice a general slow-down caused by lack of optimisation in this release - this will be addressed for DP 2.
