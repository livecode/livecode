# Overview

The LiveCode engine has undergone a large quantity of changes for the 7.0 release. The way values of variables are stored internally has been changed - in particular where before the engine used C-strings, it now uses a reference counted MCStringRef type. Every bit of code that displays text in LiveCode has been updated, and all the platform-specific API functions that manipulate characters now use the Unicode versions; as a result LiveCode is now fully Unicode compatible.
The other significant change to engine internals is the work done on syntax refactoring. The code that deals with statement execution, function evaluation and property access has been cleaned up and separated out from the parsing code, and moved into distinct modules based on functionality. This represents a major first step towards being able to implement Open Language.
