# Overview

LiveCode 9.0 enables access to libraries and platform APIs written in
many other languages thanks to the community-funded 'Infinite
LiveCode' project.

This includes a greatly improved LiveCode Builder virtual machine.

LiveCode 9.0 contains many additional improvements to support LiveCode
app developers, including:

* A new "spinner" widget

* OAuth2 authentication library for use with web APIs (e.g. Facebook,
  Google and GitHub)

* A command argument parser library for building command-line
  standalones

* Updates and performance improvements for existing widgets
