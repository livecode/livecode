# Overview

LiveCode 8.1 provides important improvements for delivering
high-quality cross-platform applications!

- LiveCode Indy and Business editions now come with the tsNet
  external, which supercharges LiveCode's Internet features and
  performance.  LiveCode 8.1 also introduces mergHealthKit, for
  accessing activity, sport and health data on iOS devices.

- The standalone builder now has a greatly-improved user experience
  for including externals, script libraries and LiveCode Builder
  extensions in your cross-platform application.  Usually, it'll now
  do the right thing automatically, but you can still select the
  specific inclusions you need.

- The IDE has lots of other upgrades, too: a keyboard-navigable
  Project Browser that highlights any scripts that failed to compile,
  an improved dictionary user interface, and access to the message box
  just by starting to type.

- The player control can be used in Windows application without any
  need for users to install any additional libraries or dependencies,
  thanks to a brand new player implementation based on DirectShow.
  For most apps, it should now be unnecessary to install or use
  QuickTime at all.

- The LiveCode Builder programming language has had some enhancements
  as part of the Infinite LiveCode project.  Variables now get
  initialised by default, `unsafe` blocks and handlers can be used to
  flag sections of code that do dangerous things, and you can even
  include raw `bytecode` if necessary.
