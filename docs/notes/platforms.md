# Platform support
The engine supports a variety of operating systems and versions. This section describes the platforms that we ensure the engine runs on without issue (although in some cases with reduced functionality).

## Windows

LiveCode supports the following versions of Windows:

* Windows XP SP2 and above
* Windows Server 2003
* Windows Vista SP1 and above (both 32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows 7 (both 32-bit and 64-bit)
* Windows Server 2008
* Windows 8.x (Desktop)

**Note:** On 64-bit Windows installations, LiveCode runs as a 32-bit application through the WoW layer.

## Linux

LiveCode supports Linux installations which meet the following requirements:

* Supported CPU architectures:
  * 32-bit or 64-bit Intel/AMD or compatible processor
  * 32-bit ARMv6 with hardware floating-point (e.g. RaspberryPi)

* Common requirements for GUI functionality:
  * GTK/GDK/Glib 2.24 or later
  * Pango with Xft support
  * esd (optional, needed for audio output)
  * mplayer (optional, needed for media player functionality)
  * lcms (optional, required for color profile support in images)
  * gksu (optional, required for privilege elevation support)

*Requirements for 32-bit Intel/AMD:
  * glibc 2.3.6 or later
*Requirements for 64-bit Intel/AMD:
  * glibc 2.15 or later
*Requirements for ARMv6:
  * glibc 2.7 or later

**Note:** If the optional requirements are not present then LiveCode will still run but the specified features will be disabled.

**Note:** The requirements for GUI functionality are also required by Firefox and Chrome, so if your Linux distritution runs one of those, it will run LiveCode.

**Note:** It may be possible to compile and run LiveCode Community for Linux on other architectures but this is not officially supported.

## Mac
The Mac engine supports:
*10.6.x (Snow Leopard) on Intel
*10.7.x (Lion) on Intel
*10.8.x (Mountain Lion) on Intel
*10.9.x (Mavericks) on Intel
*10.10.x (Yosemite) on Intel
*10.11.x (El Capitan) on Intel

**Note:** LiveCode runs as a 32-bit application regardless of the capabilities of the underlying processor.

## iOS
iOS deployment is possible when running LiveCode IDE on a Mac, and provided Xcode is installed and has been set in LiveCode *Preferences* (in the *Mobile Support* pane).

Currently, the supported versions of Xcode are:
*Xcode 4.6 on MacOS X 10.7
*Xcode 5.1 on MacOS X 10.8
*Xcode 6.2 on MacOS X 10.9
*Xcode 6.2, 6.4 and 7.1 on Mac OS X 10.10
*Xcode 7.1 on MacOS X 10.11

It is also possible to set other versions of Xcode, to allow testing on a wider range of iOS simulators. For instance, on Yosemite, you can add *Xcode 5.1* in the *Mobile Support* preferences, to let you test your stack on the *iOS Simulator 7.1*.

We currently support the following iOS Simulators:
*5.1
*6.1
*7.1
*8.2
*8.4
*9.1

## Android
LiveCode allows you to save your stack as an Android application, and also to deploy it on an Android device or simulator from the IDE.
Android deployment is possible from Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

To enable the deployment to an Android device, you need to download the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) and to install the following component, using the *Android SDK Manager*:

*Android SDK Platform for Android 4.0.3 (API 15)
*Android SDK Platform Tools
*Android SDK Build Tools

You also need to have Java *JDK 1.6* installed on your machine (or *openjdk-6* on Linux).

Once you have set the path of your Android SDK in the *LiveCode Preferences > Mobile Support*, you can deploy your stack to Android devices running Android >= 2.3.3.

Android Watch is not officially supported at the moment.
