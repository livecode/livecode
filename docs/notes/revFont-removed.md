# RevFont has been removed

The revFont external library has been removed as it is no longer required.

The two commands provided by the revFont library have been superceded by
commands that are built into the LiveCode engine. The replacements are:

- `revFontLoad` -> `start using font`
- `revFontUnload` -> `stop using font`
