////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// A capsule is sequence of sections, each independent and capable of being
// loaded as soon as all their data is available. The sections are used by the
// RRE or standalone engines to configure the environment for the running of
// the application including, but not limited to, checking security permissions,
// validating the binary data and loading the principal stack file.

// The sections are loaded in order on startup, with any unrecognized types
// ignored and skipped over. This facility means that the format can remain
// backward-compatible while still being updated with new features as newer
// engines can pick up new section types, and ignore the old ones that are
// present to allow the capsule to run in an older version.

// The sections are designed so that they can be processed as soon as all their
// data has been loaded/streamed. This means that actions can start to be taken
// before all the data has arrived.

// Sections that are fixed records are only checked for minimum data size. This
// means that some sections can be easily extended without impacting load into
// older runtime version. For example, the header section could be augmented
// with extra fields in a later version which matching runtimes could pick up
// by checking the size.

// As the capsule format is a byte-oriented stream, endianness of data-types
// is important. All data-types that are longer than 1 byte in length will
// be serialized in network (big) endian format.

// Sections always start on a 32-bit word boundary, however the size in the
// tag is always the exact byte length of the stream - this obviates the need
// for an additional size field in things such as the Stack and Image section.
// The reason for the padding is so that records can be loaded into memory whole
// and then byteswapped, rather than requiring individual elements to be
// loaded separately.

// The types of the currently defined capsule sections are defined by the
// MCCapsuleSectionType enum:
enum MCCapsuleSectionType
{
	// The epilogue section marks the end of the capsule stream. Any data
	// present beyond this is an error. (Note that this is *before* prologue
	// in the enum because it should have id 0 which matches the fact it is
	// of zero size).
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeEpilogue,

	// The prologue section contains information pertaining to the capsule as
	// a whole.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypePrologue,

	// A digest section contains the md5 digest of all data up to but not
	// including the digest section tag.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeDigest,

	// The stack section contains the principal stackfile to be loaded on
	// startup.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeStack,

	// An external section contains a external that should be loaded into the
	// environment on startup;.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeExternal,

	// Auxillary stack sections contain other mainstacks that should be loaded
	// alongside the mainstack (but not opened initially).
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeAuxillaryStack,
	
	// Simulator redirect sections contain mappings from engine relative
	// paths to absolute paths on the host system.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeRedirect,
	
	// Startup script to be executed after all stacks have loaded but before
	// the main stack is opened.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeStartupScript,
    
	// Module to be loaded on startup.
	kMCCapsuleSectionTypeModule,
};

// Each section begins with a header that defines its type and length. This is
// then immediately followed by length bytes of data. Headers themselves can be
// one or two words in length. The first word has structure:
//   bits 0..23 - length[0..23]
//   bits 24..30 - type[0..6]
//   bit 31 - extension
// If the extension bit is set, it means there is an additional word:
//   bits 0..7 - length[24..31]
//   bits 8..31 - type[7..30]
// (Obviously the ordering of the bit fields could be either way around, except
//  that with this order, it is possible to determine the header length with a 
//  single byte of look-ahead as when serialized in big-endian the initial type
//  and extension bit will be the first byte).

	uint8_t digest[16];

// The MCCapsuleRef opaque type represents a capsule while it is being loaded/
// processed. It is used by the standalone and runtime engines to launch an
// application. In order to support streaming, capsule loading follows a fill/
// process model - the caller provides data to the capsule via the Fill method
// and then can request that more sections try to be processed by calling
// Process. Note that the capsule code itself does nothing to interpret the
// sections - that is completely up to the caller. It merely provides the data.

// Given how things currently work, it would be possible to construct a rogue
// revlet that causes a significant amount of memory to be used in buffering
// an unfinished section. In order to avoid this, there is a hard limit on the
// maximum size of a section that can be buffering (note that buffering only
// occurs up to the point the capsule has been completely filled with all the
// data needed to parse the whole revlet). When a section is encountered that
// hits this hard limit the capsule becomes 'blocked' and no more sections
// will be processed until all data is available.
