// The MCParentScriptUse object represents the use of a given parent script by
// a control. The control using the parent script is called the referrer, and
// the control containing the parent script, the parent.

// The use objects form a doubly-linked list, anchored in the associated parent
// script object. This allows, for example, preservation of variables to act
// correctly when the parent script is recompiled.
//
// The use chain will also be useful for IDE level operations such as
// reassociating control's linked to one parentScript to another.

// The MCParentScript object represents a parent script that is currently being
// used by some control in the environment. Parent script objects are singletons
// keyed to a triple (id, stack, mainstack) corresponding to a unique control in
// the environment. A hash-table is used to maintain this mapping.
//
// A parent script object contains a weak-reference to the control whose script
// is to be used. This reference is broken when one of the following occurs:
//   1) The resolved control is deleted
//   2) The resolved control's id changes
//   3) The name of the resolved control's stack changes
//   4) The name of the resolved control's main stack changes.
//
// A parent script object resolves to a control by searching for the control
// matching its unique triple. This occurs at one of two points:
//   1) When a control has its parentScript property set.
//   2) Immediately after a stackfile has been loaded, when all controls are
//      iterated through to attempt to resolve references.
//
// Removing of the resolved control pointer is handled by setting of boolean
// flags on the resolved control, its stack and mainstack. This way the table
// only has to be searched when necessary as opposed to after every deletion,
// id change or name change operation.
