//   - a private format holding the application's internal data structures
//   - a generic rich text format, like RTF
//   - unformatted plain text

//

// representation to the most generic. Others don't. This interface preserves
// that ordering where it exists but makes no attempt to add one where it
// doesn't.
//
// On systems where clipboard formats are represented by integer atoms, the atom
// is resolved to its corresponding string (e.g. "TEXT" rather than 42). If that
// resolution fails (which, for example,  may happen on Windows for
// un-registered private clipboard formats), a string containing the value
// of the atom formatted as a decimal integer is returned instead.
