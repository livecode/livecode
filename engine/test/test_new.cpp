/*
  LiveCode does not use exceptions and the codebase assumes that `new`
  returns NULL if the allocation fails.  This is not the default
  behaviour of modern C++ compilers so we need to check that the
  compiler has the correct flags to get the desired behaviour.

  We need to check that:

   - If an allocation fails then new returns a null pointer and
     doesn't (try) to throw an exception.

   - If an allocation fails then the constructor is not called.
