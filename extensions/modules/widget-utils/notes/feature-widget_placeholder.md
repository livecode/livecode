# Placeholder painting
Two functions have been added to facilitate drawing placeholders on the
widget canvas for native widget display on other platforms:

- `placeholderIcon`: Takes an operating system parameter and returns an appropriate svg icon for a placeholder
- `paintPlaceholderImage`: Paint a placeholder for the widget on the given canvas

See the documentation for more details on the individual handlers and their syntax.
