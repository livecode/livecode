# Utility module added

A module, **com.livecode.widgetutils**, has been written to provide support for functions 
commonly needed by widgets. 

The functions are:
- `constrainPathToRect`: Scales and translates a Path value to fit within a rectangle
- `intToString`: Formats an integer as a string
- `stripZeroes`: Removes any superfluous zeros and decimal places from a string representation of a number.
- `colorToString`: Converts a value of type Color to an RGB or RGBA string representing the color
- `stringToColor`: Converts a comma-delimited string representing an RGB or RGBA color to a value of type Color.

See the documentation for more details on the individual handlers and their syntax.
