Summary: Scales and translates a path to fit within a rectangle

Parameters:
pTargetRect: The rectangle to fit the path within
xPath: The path to transform

Example:
use com.livecode.library.iconSVG

	-- scale the path to fit within the bounds of the widget
	constrainPathToRect(my bounds, tPath)
	
	-- fill the path
	fill tPath on this canvas

Scales and transforms <xPath> so that it fits within <pTargetRect> whilst maintaining its
aspect ratio.

Summary: Formats an integer as a string

Parameters:

Example:

<intToString> formats an integer as a string, removing the decimal place and any zeros
thereafter.
