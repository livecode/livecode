/**

Create a QR code

Example:
qrCreate "MyImage", "QR data", "M", 3

Description:
Set the text of an image to a QR code or get the PMG data of the QR code image.

Parameters:
pImg:
The name of an image object on the card, a filename or the special code "!" which
will return the image data in the result.

pData:
The data to be encoded.

pECC (enum):
The error correction level

- "L" : 7% error correction
- "M" : 15% error correction
- "Q" : 25% error correction
- "H" : 30% error correction

pSize (integer):
Module size you can make the code larger/smaller.  You can also just
rescale the image after the code has been created.

pMask (integer):
An integer value between 0 and 7. When encoding a QR code, there are
eight mask patterns that you can use to change the outputted matrix.
Each mask pattern changes the bits according to their coordinates in
the QR matrix. The purpose of a mask pattern is to make the QR code
easier for a QR scanner to read.

The result:
If successful, the first line of the result will be the following values: 
- QR version
- ECC
- Mode
- Mask
- Image size with quiet zone (based on module size 1)

If there was an error the result will contain "Error:" and then an error
description.

If the special character '!' is used for pImg, then the result also
contains the raw output of a png image.  You can use this data, for example,
with LiveCode server to generate QR codes on web pages.
