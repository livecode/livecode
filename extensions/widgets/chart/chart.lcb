/*
This widget is a chart.
*/

/*
Summary: Sets the chart data

Parameters:
pData: The data that is plotted on the graph.

Description:
Sets the chartData property of the widget.
Draws the chart based on pData, where pData is a line delimited list with each line containing a point on the graph.
e.g.
x_1, y_1
x_2, y_2
x_3, y_3
draws a line graph with 3 points at (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) and (x_3, y_3)

To draw n lines on the graph, add n y coordinates for each x coordinate
e.g.
x_1, y_1a, y_1b
x_2, y_2a, y_2b
draws a line with with points at (x_1, y_1a), (x_2, y_2a) and line with points (x_1, y_1b), (x_2, y_2b) on the same set of axes.
*/
/*

Summary: Sets the value of the increments on the x axis.

Parameters:
pValue: The value of the increments on the x axis.

Description:
Sets the xIncrements property of the widget.
Draws the increments on the x axis as set by pValue.
*/

/*
Summary: Sets the visibility of the vertical grid lines

*/

/*
Summary: Sets the color of the chart

Parameters:
pLabels: A comma delimited list of colors.

Description:
Sets the chartColors property of the widget.
*/
/*

Description:
Sets the showHGrid property of the widget.
If pVisible is true, then the horizontal grid lines are drawn.
*/
/*
Summary: Sets the value of the increments on the y axis.

pValue: The value of the increments on the y axis.

Description:
Sets the yIncrements property of the widget.
Draws the increments on the y axis as set by pValue.
*/
/*
Summary: Sets the maximum value on the y axis

Parameters:
pValue: The maximum y value.

Description:
Sets the yMax property of the widget.
Draws the y axis with a maximum value as set by pValue.
