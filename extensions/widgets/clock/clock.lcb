/*
This widget consists of an analogue clock. The clock has day and night style displays which
are used depending on the time. The period interpreted as day by the clock is controlled by
a pair of constants kStartDay and kEndDay, currently set at 6 and 20 respectively. Thus the
clock will display in night style between the hours of 8pm and 6am. The only settable property
implemented by this clock widget is the timeZone, an integer which adjusts the time displayed
relative to universal time (UTC).

Name: timeZone
Type: property
Syntax: set the timeZone of <widget> to <pTimeZone>
Syntax: get the timeZone of <widget>

Summary: The time zone of the clock widget.

pTimeZone (integer): An integer representing the timeZone in which to calculate the time.

Example:
// Make the clocks display the correct time in Japan and Panama respectively
set the timeZone of widget "Japan Clock" to 9
set the timeZone of widget "Panama Clock" to -5

Description:
The <timeZone> property determines what time is displayed on the clock. If the <timeZone> is 0, the clock will display
the universal time (UTC).

*>Note:* The timeZone is restricted to being an integer.
