## Creating a Clock
A clock widget can be created by dragging it out from the Tools
Palette, where it appears with the following icon:

<svg viewBox="0 0 70 70" style="display:block;margin:auto" width="auto" height="50">
  <path d="M31.7,0C14.2,0,0,14.2,0,31.7s14.2,31.7,31.7,31.7s31.7-14.2,31.7-31.7S49.2,0,31.7,0z M30.2,3.2h2.8v7.3h-2.8V3.2zM10.4,33.1H3.1v-2.8h7.3V33.1z M12.5,52.9l-2-2l5.2-5.2l2,2L12.5,52.9z M15.7,17.7l-5.2-5.2l2-2l5.2,5.2L15.7,17.7z M33.1,60.2h-2.8v-7.3h2.8V60.2z M42.3,45.4L31.8,34.9c0,0-0.1,0-0.1,0c-1.7,0-3-1.3-3-3c0-1.1,0.6-2.1,1.6-2.6V12.9h2.8v16.3c0.9,0.5,1.6,1.5,1.6,2.6c0,0.2,0,0.4-0.1,0.5L45,42.8L42.3,45.4z M50.8,52.9l-5.2-5.2l2-2l5.2,5.2L50.8,52.9z M47.7,17.7l-2-2l5.2-5.2l2,2L47.7,17.7z M52.9,33.1v-2.8h7.3v2.8H52.9z" />
</svg>


Alternatively it can be created in script using:

	create widget as "com.livecode.widget.clock"

## Clock Display

When the clock is displaying an AM time, the hands are dark on a light 
background, and when displaying a PM time, the hands are light on a dark 
background.

The read-only property `isDay` also reflects whether the current time is 
AM or PM.
