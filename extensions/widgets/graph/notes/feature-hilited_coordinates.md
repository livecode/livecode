# hilitedCoordinates Property
The graph widget now has a hilitedCoordinates property, which allows
the point corresponding to a particular pair of values to be indicated 
on the graph. The point does not have to coincide with any data point 
currently displayed on the graph.

The hilitedCoordinates are indicated by an additional circular point at 
the specified location, as well as dotted lines going from the point to
both the axes.
