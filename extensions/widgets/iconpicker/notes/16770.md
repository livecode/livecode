# Layout calculations

The icon size of the icon picker is now fixed at 65 pixels. The number 
of rows/columns therefore now depends on the height/width. The widget 
will clip instead of reducing the number of rows or columns to below 3.

The `preferredSize` of the icon picker is now calculated as the minimum
size to display 5 rows and columns of icons in the view.
