# Segment widths

When the segmented control's `segmentDisplay` property is set to "text", the widths of the segments
are calculated using the following rules:

- Measure the text, and assign widths accordingly
- Increase the size of any segments that are smaller than the corresponding `segmentMinWidth`
- If there is any space left in the widget bounds, increase each segment's size to fill the space

If after measuring and increasing to take min widths into account the segments will not fit, the 
segmented control will clip the content rather than shrink it.
