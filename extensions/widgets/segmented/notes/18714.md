# Properties

* Setting the **itemCount** now updates all other properties
  immediately, rather than at the next redraw
* All list-like properties now contain exactly **itemCount** items at
  all times
* The **itemNames** property may now include duplicated and/or empty
  segment names

# [18714] Ensure all `itemNames`, `itemLabels` etc. can be set to empty
