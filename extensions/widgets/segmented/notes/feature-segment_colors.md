# Segment Colors

Four new properties have been added to the segmented control:

* `segmentColor`: the background color of the unselected segments
* `segmentSelectedColor`: the background color of the selected segments.
* `segmentLabelColor`: the label color of the unselected segments.
* `segmentSelectedLabelColor`: the label color of the selected segments.

Where any of these are empty, the control instead uses its associated default color.
