/* 
A segmented control. A segmented control is a horizontal control that is made up of 
multiple segments, where each segment functions as a discrete button.

Name: segmentSelected
Type: message
Syntax: on segmentSelected <pSegment>

Summary: Sent when a segment is selected

Parameters:
pSegment: The name of the newly selected segment

Description:
Handle the <segmentSelected> message in order to respond to a user clicking on a segment
to select it.

>*Note:* if the <selectedSegment> property is set by manually (by script or through the 
property inspector), the <segmentSelected> message will not be set, because some segments
will be selected and others deselected simultaneously. It is usually better to handle the 
<selectionChanged> message.

References: selectedSegment (property), selectionChanged (message), segmentUnselected (message)

Name: segmentUnselected
Type: message
Syntax: on segmentUnselected <pSegment>

Summary: Sent when a segment is unselected

Parameters:
pSegment: The name of the newly unselected segment

Description:
Handle the <segmentUnselected> message in order to respond to a user clicking on a segment
to unselect it.

>*Note:* if the <selectedSegment> property is set by manually (by script or through the 
property inspector), the <segmentUnselected> message will not be set, because some segments
will be selected and others deselected simultaneously. It is usually better to handle the 
<selectionChanged> message.

References: selectedSegment (property), selectionChanged (message), segmentSelected (message)

Name: selectionChanged
Type: message
Syntax: on selectionChanged <pList>

Summary: Sent when the selection of the segmented control widget changes

Parameters:
pList: A comma delimited list of the selected segment names

Description:
Handle the <selectionChanged> message in order to respond to a change in the selection
of the segmented control.
