# Properties

Two new properties have been added in order to allow the key-value pairs of the tree view
to be displayed in separate columns: **showSeparator** and **separatorRatio**.

The **showSeparator** property controls whether the tree view is in
columns or not. The **separatorRatio** property controls where the
separator is.  More specifically, it is the proportion of the view
space that is taken up by the key column.

When the **showSeparator** property is true, the separator can be
dragged by the user to resize the columns.
