PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================
  
This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces including some of the more
common listed below:

C++ - http://thaiopensource.org/development/libpqxx/
JDBC - http://jdbc.postgresql.org
ODBC - http://odbc.postgresql.org
Perl - http://search.cpan.org/~dbdpg/
PHP - http://www.php.net
Python - http://www.initd.org/
Ruby - http://ruby.scripting.ca/postgres/

Other language binding are available from a variety of contributing
parties.

PostgreSQL also has a great number of procedural languages available,
a short but not complete list is below:

PL/pgSQL - included in PostgreSQL source distribution
PL/Perl - included in PostgreSQL source distribution

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Changes between all PostgreSQL releases are recorded in the
file HISTORY.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.
