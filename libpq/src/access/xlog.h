 * The overall layout of an XLOG record is:
 *		Fixed-size header (XLogRecord struct)
 *		rmgr-specific data
 *		BkpBlock
 *		backup block data
 *		BkpBlock
 *		backup block data
 *		...
 *
 * where there can be zero to three backup blocks (as signaled by xl_info flag
 * bits).  XLogRecord structs always start on MAXALIGN boundaries in the WAL
 * files, and we round up SizeOfXLogRecord so that the rmgr data is also
 * guaranteed to begin on a MAXALIGN boundary.	However, no padding is added
 * to align BkpBlock structs or backup block data.
 *
 * NOTE: xl_len counts only the rmgr data, not the XLogRecord header,
 * and also not any backup blocks.	xl_tot_len counts everything.  Neither
 * length field is rounded up to an alignment boundary.

 * The rmgr data to be written by XLogInsert() is defined by a chain of
 * one or more XLogRecData structs.  (Multiple structs would be used when
 * parts of the source data aren't physically adjacent in memory, or when
 * multiple associated buffers need to be specified.)
 *
 * If buffer is valid then XLOG will check if buffer must be backed up
 * (ie, whether this is first change of that page since last checkpoint).
 * If so, the whole page contents are attached to the XLOG record, and XLOG
 * sets XLR_BKP_BLOCK_X bit in xl_info.  Note that the buffer must be pinned
 * and exclusive-locked by the caller, so that it won't change under us.
 * NB: when the buffer is backed up, we DO NOT insert the data pointed to by
 * this XLogRecData struct into the XLOG record, since we assume it's present
 * in the buffer.  Therefore, rmgr redo routines MUST pay attention to
 * XLR_BKP_BLOCK_X to know what is actually stored in the XLOG record.
 * The i'th XLR_BKP_BLOCK bit corresponds to the i'th distinct buffer
 * value (ignoring InvalidBuffer) appearing in the rdata chain.
 *
 * When buffer is valid, caller must set buffer_std to indicate whether the
 * page uses standard pd_lower/pd_upper header fields.	If this is true, then
 * XLOG is allowed to omit the free space between pd_lower and pd_upper from
 * the backed-up page image.  Note that even when buffer_std is false, the
 * page MUST have an LSN field as its first eight bytes!
 *
 * Note: data can be NULL to indicate no rmgr data associated with this chain
 * entry.  This can be sensible (ie, not a wasted entry) if buffer is valid.
 * The implication is that the buffer has been changed by the operation being
 * logged, and so may need to be backed up, but the change can be redone using
 * only information already present elsewhere in the XLOG entry.
