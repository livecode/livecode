Summary:        Returns the keys of an array.
Target:         An expression which evaluates to an array.

Returns: 	A list whose elements are the keys of <Target>. 

Example:
	variable tArray as Array
	put the empty array into tArray
	put "value1" into tArray["key1"]
	put "value2" into tArray["key2"]
	put "value3" into tArray["key3"]
	
	variable tKeys as List
	put the keys of tArray into tKeys
	sort tKeys in ascending order
	
	variable tKeysString as String
	combine tKeys with "," into tKeysString 
	// tKeysString is "key1,key2,key3"

Summary:        Determines if an array has a given key
Needle:         An expression which evaluates to an integer, string, or list of integers.
Target:         An expression which evaluates to an array.

Returns: 	Returns true if <Needle> can be found among the keys of <Target>.

Example:
	variable tArray as Array
	put "value" into tArray["key"]
	
	variable tIsAmong as Boolean
	put "key" is among the keys of tArray into tIsAmong -- tIsAmong is true

Description:
The keys of an array are case insensitive. Thus
``` tVar is among the keys of tArray``` 
is not equivalent to 
``` tVar is in (the keys of tArray) ```
as the latter <IsInList> operation *is* case sensitive.

Description:
Elements are compared using the default comparison for that type. Thus for a string, ```tString```, 
```tString is among the elements of tArray```
