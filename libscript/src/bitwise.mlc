/*
Summary:        Performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representations of <Left> and <Right>.

Left:           An expression which evaluates to an integer.
Right:          An expression which evaluates to an integer.

Returns: 	The integer whose binary representation is the result of the bitwise AND operation.

Example:
	variable tVar as number
	put 3 bitwise and 6 into tVar -- tVar contains 2
	
Description:
Each bit of <Left> bitwise and <Right> is 1 if and only if both the corresponding bit of the binary representation of <Left> and that of <Right> is 1. Otherwise it is 0.

Each bit of <Left> bitwise xor <Right> is 1 if and only if exactly one of the corresponding bits of the binary representation of <Left> and that of <Right> is 1. Otherwise it is 0.

Summary:        Performs a bitwise NOT operation on the binary representation of <Operand>.

Returns: 	The integer whose binary representation is the result of the bitwise NOT operation.

Example:
	variable tVar as number
	put bitwise not -5 into tVar -- tVar contains 4

Description:
Bitwise not returns the complement of <Operand> as a signed 32-bit integer, thus is equivalent to -(x + 1).

/*
Summary:       Shifts the bits of <Operand> left or right.

Operand:        An expression which evaluates to an integer.
Shift:          An expression which evaluates to an integer.

Returns: 	The result of bit-shifting <Operand> by <Shift> places.

Example:
	variable tVar
	put 7 shifted by 2 bitwise into tVar -- tVar contains 28

Description:
Shifts the bits of <Operand> left or right. If neither direction is specified, then shifts left. Shifting the bits of <Operand> left by x is equivalent to multiplying by 2^x. Shifting by a negative value is equivalent to shifting by its absolute value in the opposite direction.
