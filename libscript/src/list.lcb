Source:             An expression which evaluates to a list.
Index:              An expression which evaluates to a valid integer index of <Target>.
Target:             An expression which evaluates to a list.

Example:
	variable tVar as List
	put the empty list into tVar
	
	variable tCount as Number
	put 2 into tCount
	repeat 3 times
		push tCount onto tVar
	end repeat
	
	variable tVar2 as List
	push 1 onto tVar2
	push 5 onto tVar2
	
	splice tVar before element 2 of tVar2 -- tVar2 contains the list [1,2,3,4,5]
	

Description:
Use the splice syntax to insert the elements of one list into another list. 

>*Note:* ```put tList before element 2 of tList2``` results in the insertion of tList **as an element**, i.e. tList2 becomes the list [element 1 of tList2,tList,element 2 of tList2, element 3 of tList2 ...]

>*Note:* It is an error if <Index> is out of range.
