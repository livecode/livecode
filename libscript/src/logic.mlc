Summary:    Returns the boolean-logical value of the expression '<Left> and <Right>'

Left:       An expression that evaluates to a boolean value
Right:      An expression that evaluates to a boolean value

Returns: 	If the left hand expression evaluates to false, the value of the expression is false.
            Otherwise, the operator evaluates to the value of the right hand expression.
            Note that the right hand expression is only evaluated if the left hand expression is true.
