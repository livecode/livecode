/*
Summary:        Splits the string in <Target> into a list of strings, using <Delimiter>
                as the delimiter.

Target:         An expression that evaluates to a string container.
Delimiter:      An expression that evaluates to a string.

Example:
	variable tVar as string
    put "first,second,third,fourth,fifth" into tVar
    variable tSplit as list
    split tVar by "," into tSplit
    put element 1 of tSplit into tFirstElement // tFirstElement contains "first"
    
Description:
Use the split command to convert a string representation of a list into a genuine (ordered) list.

Summary:        Combines the list of strings in <Target>, using <Delimiter>
                as the delimiter. 
                
Target:         An expression that evaluates to a list container.
Delimiter:      An expression that evaluates to a string.

Example:
	variable tDigits as list
	put [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] into tDigits
	
	variable tString as string
    combine tDigits with "|" into tString // tString contains "1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9"
            
Description:
Use the combine command to convert a list into a string representation of the list.

>*Note:* The list *must* consist entirely of string elements, otherwise the combine command will throw an error.
