/*
** How This Encoder Works
**
** The output is allowed to contain any character except 0x27 (') and
** 0x00.  This is accomplished by using an escape character to encode
** 0x27 and 0x00 as a two-byte sequence.  The escape character is always
** 0x01.  An 0x00 is encoded as the two byte sequence 0x01 0x01.  The
** 0x27 character is encoded as the two byte sequence 0x01 0x03.  Finally,
** the escape character itself is encoded as the two-character sequence
** 0x01 0x02.
**
** To summarize, the encoder works by using an escape sequences as follows:
**
**       0x00  ->  0x01 0x01
**       0x01  ->  0x01 0x02
**       0x27  ->  0x01 0x03
**
** If that were all the encoder did, it would work, but in certain cases
** it could double the size of the encoded string.  For example, to
** encode a string of 100 0x27 characters would require 100 instances of
** the 0x01 0x03 escape sequence resulting in a 200-character output.
** We would prefer to keep the size of the encoded string smaller than
** this.
**
** To minimize the encoding size, we first add a fixed offset value to each 
** byte in the sequence.  The addition is modulo 256.  (That is to say, if
** the sum of the original character value and the offset exceeds 256, then
** the higher order bits are truncated.)  The offset is chosen to minimize
** the number of characters in the string that need to be escaped.  For
** example, in the case above where the string was composed of 100 0x27
** characters, the offset might be 0x01.  Each of the 0x27 characters would
** then be converted into an 0x28 character which would not need to be
** escaped at all and so the 100 character input string would be converted
** into just 100 characters of output.  Actually 101 characters of output - 
** we have to record the offset used as the first byte in the sequence so
** that the string can be decoded.  Since the offset value is stored as
** part of the output string and the output string is not allowed to contain
** characters 0x00 or 0x27, the offset cannot be 0x00 or 0x27.
**
** Here, then, are the encoding steps:
**
**     (1)   Choose an offset value and make it the first character of
**           output.
**
**     (2)   Copy each input character into the output buffer, one by
**           one, adding the offset value as you copy.
**
**     (3)   If the value of an input character plus offset is 0x00, replace
**           that one character by the two-character sequence 0x01 0x01.
**           If the sum is 0x01, replace it with 0x01 0x02.  If the sum
**           is 0x27, replace it with 0x01 0x03.
**
**     (4)   Put a 0x00 terminator at the end of the output.
**
** Decoding is obvious:
**
**     (5)   Copy encoded characters except the first into the decode 
**           buffer.  Set the first encoded character aside for use as
**           the offset in step 7 below.
**
**     (6)   Convert each 0x01 0x01 sequence into a single character 0x00.
**           Convert 0x01 0x02 into 0x01.  Convert 0x01 0x03 into 0x27.
**
**     (7)   Subtract the offset value that was the first character of
**           the encoded buffer from all characters in the output buffer.
**
** The only tricky part is step (1) - how to compute an offset value to
** minimize the size of the output buffer.  This is accomplished by testing
** all offset values and picking the one that results in the fewest number
** of escapes.  To do that, we first scan the entire input and count the
** number of occurances of each character value in the input.  Suppose
** the number of 0x00 characters is N(0), the number of occurances of 0x01
** is N(1), and so forth up to the number of occurances of 0xff is N(255).
** An offset of 0 is not allowed so we don't have to test it.  The number
** of escapes required for an offset of 1 is N(1)+N(2)+N(40).  The number
** of escapes required for an offset of 2 is N(2)+N(3)+N(41).  And so forth.
** In this way we find the offset that gives the minimum number of escapes,
** and thus minimizes the length of the output string.

** null-terminated and can be used as a string value in an INSERT
** or UPDATE statement.  Use sqlite_decode_binary() to convert the
** string back into its original binary.
**
** The result is written into a preallocated output buffer "out".
** "out" must be able to hold at least 2 +(257*n)/254 bytes.
** In other words, the output will be expanded by as much as 3
** bytes for every 254 bytes of input plus 2 bytes of fixed overhead.
** (This is approximately 2 + 1.0118*n or about a 1.2% size increase.)
**
** The return value is the number of characters in the encoded
** string, excluding the "\000" terminator.
