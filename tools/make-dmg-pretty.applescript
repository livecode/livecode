			-- According to http://joemaller.com/659/setting-icon-position-and-window-size-on-disk-images/, Finder sometimes does not save the size and position of a window until it detects user interaction on either the window's resizing handle or its zoom button. Simulate two clicks on the zoom button to trigger the save.
